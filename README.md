# Fluid Self

My portfolio site and book notes repository is built with the static site generator [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), which converts pages in Markdown format to HTML, with the help of [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. The `build.js` file outlines the Metalsmith workflow.

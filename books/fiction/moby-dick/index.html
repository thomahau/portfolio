However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good–natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.</p><p>There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method.</p><p>I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the country.</p><p>I heard Ahab mutter, &#39;Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.&#39; And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!&quot;</p><p>In an instant&#39;s compass, great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men&#39;s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life–time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.</p></section></main></div></body></html>

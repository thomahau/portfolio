Not that I&#39;m such a blasé, convenience-sake sort of guy--although I do have tendencies in that direction--but because more often than not I&#39;ve observed that convenient approximations bring you closest to comprehending the true nature of things.</p><p>I had my digital alarm clock set to an alternating one-hour–thirty-minutes–one-hour–thirty-minutes cycle by which I worked and rested, worked and rested. The clock face was covered over so I couldn&#39;t read it. Time gets in the way of tabulations. Whatever the time was now, it had no bearing on my work. My work begins when I start tabulating and it ends when I stop. The only time I need to know about is the one-hour–thirty-minutes–one-hour–thirty-minutes cycle.</p><p>You are caught between all that was and all that must be. You feel lost.</p><p>Were the stars out when I left the house last evening? All I could remember was the couple in the Skyline listening to Duran Duran. Stars? Who remembers stars? Come to think of it, had I even looked up at the sky recently? Had the stars been wiped out of the sky three months ago, I wouldn&#39;t have known. The only things I noticed were silver bracelets on women&#39;s wrists and popsicle sticks in potted rubber plants. There had to be something wrong with my life. I should have been born a Yugoslavian shepherd who looked up at the Big Dipper every night. No car, no car stereo, no silver bracelets, no shuffling, no dark blue tweed suits.</p><p>Even if I had my life to live over again, I couldn&#39;t imagine not doing things the same. After all, everything--this life I was losing--was me. And I couldn&#39;t be any other self but my self. Could I? Once, when I was younger, I thought I could be someone else. I&#39;d move to Casablanca, open a bar, and I&#39;d meet Ingrid Bergman. Or more realistically--whether actually more realistic or not--I&#39;d tune in on a better life, something more suited to my true self. Toward that end, I had to undergo training. I read The Greening of America, and I saw Easy Rider three times. But like a boat with a twisted rudder, I kept coming back to the same place. I wasn&#39;t going anywhere. I was myself, waiting on the shore for me to return. Was that so depressing? Who knows? Maybe that was &quot;despair&quot;. What Turgenev called &quot;disillusionment&quot;. Or Dostoyevsky, &quot;hell&quot;. Or Somerset Maugham, &quot;reality&quot;. Whatever the label, I figured it was me.</p></section></main></div></body></html>

Abysmal change widened their souls out in a brooding unconsciousness.</p><p>&quot;Why do you wear the big hat?&quot; asked Eugene. &quot;Psychology,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes &#39;em talk.&quot; &quot;I tell you what!&quot; said Eliza, beginning to laugh. &quot;That&#39;s pretty smart, isn&#39;t it?&quot; &quot;Sure!&quot; said Luke. &quot;That&#39;s advertising! It pays to advertise!&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Barton slowly, &quot;you&#39;ve got to get the other fellow&#39;s psychology.&quot; The phrase seemed to describe an action of modified assault and restrained pillage.</p></section></main></div></body></html>

Carr points out that the sense impressions of one-celled animals are not edited for the brain: &quot;This is philosophically interesting in a rather mournful way, since it means that only the simplest animals perceive the universe as it is.&quot;</p><p>Seeing is of course very much a matter of verbalization. Unless I call my attention to what passes before my eyes, I simply won&#39;t see it. It is, as Ruskin says, &quot;not merely unnoticed, but in the full, clear sense of the word, unseen.&quot; My eyes alone can&#39;t solve analogy tests using figures, the ones which show, with increasing elaborations, a big square, then a small square in a big square, then a big triangle, and expect me to find a small triangle in a big triangle. I have to say the words, describe what I&#39;m seeing. If Tinker Mountain erupted, I&#39;d be likely to notice. But if I want to notice the lesser cataclysms of valley life, I have to maintain in my head a running description of the present. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m observant; it&#39;s just that I talk too much. Otherwise, especially in a strange place, I&#39;ll never know what&#39;s happening. Like a blind man at the ball game, I need a radio.</p><p>When I see this way I analyze and pry. I hurl over logs and roll away stones; I study the bank a square foot at a time, probing and tilting my head. Some days when a mist covers the mountains, when the muskrats won&#39;t show and the microscope&#39;s mirror shatters, I want to climb up the blank blue dome as a man would storm the inside of a circus tent, wildly, dangling, and with a steel knife claw a rent in the top, peep, and, if I must, fall.</p><p>But there is another kind of seeing that involves a letting go. When I see this way I sway transfixed and emptied. The difference between the two ways of seeing is the difference between walking with and without a camera. When I walk with a camera I walk from shot to shot, reading the light on a calibrated meter. When I walk without a camera, my own shutter opens, and the moment&#39;s light prints on my own silver gut. When I see this second way I am above all an unscrupulous observer. When I see this way I see truly. As Thoreau says, I return to my senses. I am the man who watches the baseball game in silence in an empty stadium. I see the game purely; I&#39;m abstracted and dazed. When it&#39;s all over and the white-suited players lope off the green field to their shadowed dugouts, I leap to my feet; I cheer and cheer.</p><p>But I can&#39;t go out and try to see this way. I&#39;ll fail, I&#39;ll go mad. All I can do is try to gag the commentator, to hush the noise of useless interior babble that keeps me from seeing just as surely as a newspaper dangled before my eyes. The effort is really a discipline requiring a lifetime of dedicated struggle; it marks the literature of saints and monks of every order East and West, under every rule and no rule, discalced and shod. The world&#39;s spiritual geniuses seem to discover universally that the mind&#39;s muddy river, this ceaseless flow of trivia and trash, cannot be dammed, and that trying to dam it is a waste of effort that might lead to madness. Instead you must allow the muddy river to flow un-heeded in the dim channels of consciousness; you raise your sights; you look along it, mildly, acknowledging its presence without interest and gazing beyond it into the realm of the real where subjects and objects act and rest purely, without utterance.</p><p>I bloom indoors in the winter like a forced forsythia; I come in to come out. At night I read and write, and things I have never understood become clear; I reap the harvest of the rest of the year&#39;s planting.</p><p>Sometimes an Eskimo would catch a wolf with a knife. He slathered the knife with blubber and buried the hilt in snow or ice. A hungry wolf would scent the blubber, find the knife, and lick it compulsively with numbed tongue, until he sliced his tongue to ribbons, and bled to death.</p><p>I wonder how long it would take you to notice the regular recurrence of the seasons if you were the first man on earth. What would it be like to live in open-ended time broken only by days and nights? You could say, &quot;it&#39;s cold again; it was cold before,&quot; but you couldn&#39;t make the key connection and say, &quot;it was cold this time last year,&quot; because the notion of &quot;year&quot; is precisely the one you lack. Assuming that you hadn&#39;t yet noticed any orderly progression of heavenly bodies, how long would you have to live on earth before you could feel with any assurance that any one particular long period of cold would, in fact, end?</p><p>Self-consciousness is the curse of the city and all that sophistication implies. It is the glimpse of oneself in a storefront window, the unbidden awareness of reactions on the faces of other people--the novelist&#39;s world, not the poet&#39;s.</p><p>What I call innocence is the spirit&#39;s unself-conscious state at any moment of pure devotion to any object. It is at once a receptiveness and total concentration.</p><p>Trees do not accumulate life, but deadwood, like a thickening coat of mail. Their odds actually improve as they age. Some trees, like giant sequoias, are, practically speaking, immortal, vulnerable only to another ice age. They are not even susceptible to fire. Sequoia wood barely burns, and the bark is &quot;nearly as fireproof as asbestos.&quot;</p><p>It is spring. I plan to try to control myself this year, to watch the progress of the season in a calm and orderly fashion. In spring I am prone to wretched excess. I abandon myself to flights and compulsions; I veer into various states of physical disarray.</p><p>In summer, I stalk. Summer leaves obscure, heat dazzles, and creatures hide from the red-eyed sun, and me. I have to seek things out. The creatures I seek have several senses and free will; it becomes apparent that they do not wish to be seen. I can stalk them in either of two ways. The first is not what you think of as true stalking, but it is the Via negativa, and as fruitful as actual pursuit. When I stalk this way I take my stand on a bridge and wait, emptied. I put myself in the way of the creature&#39;s passage, like spring Eskimos at a seal&#39;s breathing hole. Something might come; something might go. I am Newton under the apple tree, Buddha under the bo. Stalking the other way, I forge my own passage seeking the creature. I wander the banks; what I find, I follow, doggedly, like Eskimos haunting the caribou herds. I am Wilson squinting after the traces of electrons in a cloud chamber; I am Jacob at Peniel wrestling with the angel.</p><p>I wonder if we do not waste most of our energy just by spending every waking minute saying hello to ourselves.</p><p>Locusts are grasshoppers: they are the same animal. Swarms of locusts are ordinary grasshoppers gone berserk. If you take ordinary grasshoppers of any of several species from any of a number of the world&#39;s dry regions--including the Rocky Mountains--and rear them in glass jars under crowded conditions, they go into the migratory phase. That is, they turn into locusts. They literally and physically change from Jekyll to Hyde before your eyes. They will even change, all alone in their jars, if you stimulate them by a rapid succession of artificial touches. Imperceptibly at first, their wings and wing-covers elongate. Their drab color heightens, then saturates more and more, until it locks at the hysterical locust yellows and pinks. Stripes and dots appear on the wing-covers; these deepen to a glittering black. They lay more egg-pods than grasshoppers. They are restless, excitable, voracious. You now have jars full of plague.</p><p>A kind of northing is what I wish to accomplish, a single-minded trek towards that place where any shutter left open to the zenith at night will record the wheeling of all the sky&#39;s stars as a pattern of perfect, concentric circles. I seek a reduction, a shedding, a sloughing off.</p><p>The death of the self of which the great writers speak is no violent act. It is merely the joining of the great rock heart of the earth in its roll. It is merely the slow cessation of the will&#39;s sprints and the intellect&#39;s chatter: it is waiting like a hollow bell with stilled tongue. Fuge, tace, quiesce. The waiting itself is the thing.</p></section></main></div></body></html>

This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have been from time to time engag&#39;d in promoting.</p><p>So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.</p><p>I grew convinc&#39;d that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life; and I form&#39;d written resolutions, which still remain in my journal book, to practice them ever while I lived.</p><p>I had form&#39;d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss&#39;d by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and, to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.</p><p>I conceiv&#39;d the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection. I wish&#39;d to live without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined. While my care was employ&#39;d in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and established, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the following method.</p><p>I included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr&#39;d to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept, which fully express&#39;d the extent I gave to its meaning. These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:</p><ol><li><p><strong>TEMPERANCE.</strong> Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.</p></li><li><p><strong>SILENCE.</strong> Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.</p></li><li><p><strong>ORDER.</strong> Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.</p></li><li><p><strong>RESOLUTION.</strong> Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.</p></li><li><p><strong>FRUGALITY.</strong> Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.</p></li><li><p><strong>INDUSTRY.</strong> Lose no time; be always employ&#39;d in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>SINCERITY.</strong> Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.</p></li><li><p><strong>JUSTICE.</strong> Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.</p></li><li><p><strong>MODERATION.</strong> Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.</p></li><li><p><strong>CLEANLINESS.</strong> Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.</p></li><li><p><strong>TRANQUILLITY.</strong> Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.</p></li><li><p><strong>CHASTITY.</strong> Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dulness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another&#39;s peace or reputation.</p></li><li><p><strong>HUMILITY.</strong> Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</p></li></ol><p>My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judg&#39;d it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro&#39; the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang&#39;d them with that view, as they stand above. Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in his Golden Verses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination. I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues. I rul&#39;d each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day. I cross&#39;d these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day. I determined to give a week&#39;s strict attention to each of the virtues successively.</p><p>On the whole, tho&#39; I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, tho&#39; they never reach the wish&#39;d-for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavor, and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible.</p><p>I have always thought that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business.</p><p>&quot;He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.&quot; It shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings.</p><p>As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.</p><p>Human felicity is produc&#39;d not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day.</p></section></main></div></body></html>

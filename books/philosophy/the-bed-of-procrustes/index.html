They are never the same.</p><p>The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.</p><p>My only measure of success is how much time you have to kill.</p><p>Only in recent history has &quot;working hard&quot; signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura.</p><p>We are hunters; we are only truly alive in those moments when we improvise; no schedule, just small surprises and stimuli from the environment.</p><p>Skills that transfer: street fights, off-path hiking, seduction, broad erudition. Skills that don&#39;t: school, games, sports, laboratory--what&#39;s reduced and organized.</p><p>You need to keep reminding yourself of the obvious: charm lies in the unsaid, the unwritten, and the undisplayed. It takes mastery to control silence.</p><p>It is much less dangerous to think like a man of action than to act like a man of thought.</p><p>What I learned on my own I still remember.</p><p>We unwittingly amplify commonalities with friends, dissimilarities with strangers, and contrasts with enemies.</p><p>The sucker&#39;s trap is when you focus on what you know and what others don&#39;t know, rather than the reverse.</p><p>Wit seduces by signaling intelligence without nerdiness.</p><p>Avoid calling heroes those who had no other choice.</p><p>English does not distinguish between arrogant-up (irreverence toward the temporarily powerful) and arrogant-down (directed at the small guy).</p><p>When conflicted between two choices, take neither.</p><p>It takes extraordinary wisdom and self-control to accept that many things have a logic we do not understand that is smarter than our own.</p><p>They think that intelligence is about noticing things that are relevant (detecting patterns); in a complex world, intelligence consists in ignoring things that are irrelevant (avoiding false patterns).</p><p>The ancients knew very well that the only way to understand events was to cause them.</p><p>It takes a lot of intellect and confidence to accept that what makes sense doesn&#39;t really make sense.</p><p>The best test of whether someone is extremely stupid (or extremely wise) is whether financial and political news makes sense to him.</p><p>What makes us fragile is that institutions cannot have the same virtues (honor, truthfulness, courage, loyalty, tenacity) as individuals.</p><p>Mediocre men tend to be outraged by small insults but passive, subdued, and silent in front of very large ones.</p><p>Those who have nothing to prove never say that they have nothing to prove.</p><p>How superb to become wise without being boring; how sad to be boring without being wise.</p><p>A verbal threat is the most authentic certificate of impotence.</p><p>By all means, avoid words--threats, complaints, justification, narratives, reframing, attempts to win arguments, supplications; avoid words!</p><p>You know you have influence when people start noticing your absence more than the presence of others.</p><p>For company, you often prefer those who find you interesting over those you find interesting.</p><p>At any stage, humans can thirst for money, knowledge, or love; sometimes for two, never for three.</p><p>As the reader can see from my aphorisms, I have respect for mother nature&#39;s methods of robustness (billions of years allow most of what is fragile to break); classical thought is more robust (in its respect for the unknown, the epistemic humility) than the modern post-Enlightenment na√Øve pseudoscientific autism. Thus my classical values make me advocate the triplet of erudition, elegance, and courage; against modernity&#39;s phoniness, nerdiness, and philistinism.</p></section></main></div></body></html>

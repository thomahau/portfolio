Any of these acts will elicit Resistance.</p><p>Resistance will unfailingly point to true North - meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing. We can use this. We can use it as a compass. We can navigate by Resistance, letting it guide us to that calling or purpose that we must follow before all others. Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul&#39;s evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.</p><p>Fear doesn&#39;t go away. The battle must be fought anew every day.</p><p>Don&#39;t think. Act. We can always revise and revisit once we&#39;ve acted. But we can accomplish nothing until we act.</p><p>When is the best time to start? Start Before You&#39;re Ready. Don&#39;t prepare. Begin.</p><p>The enemy is our chattering brain, which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications, and a million reasons why we can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t/won&#39;t do what we know we need to do.</p><p>Research can become Resistance.</p><p>Act, reflect. Act, reflect. NEVER act and reflect at the same time. &quot;Action&quot; means putting words on paper. &quot;Reflection&quot; means evaluating what we have on paper.</p><p>When an idea pops into our head and we think, &quot;No, this is too crazy,&quot; â€¦ that&#39;s the idea we want.</p><p>Resistance arises second. What comes first is the idea, the passion, the dream of the work we are so excited to create that it scares the hell out of us. Resistance is the response of the frightened, petty, small-time ego to the brave, generous, magnificent impulse of the creative self.</p><p>A crash means we&#39;re at the threshold of learning something, which means we&#39;re getting better, we&#39;re acquiring the wisdom of our craft. A crash compels us to figure out what works and what doesn&#39;t work - and to understand the difference.</p></section></main></div></body></html>

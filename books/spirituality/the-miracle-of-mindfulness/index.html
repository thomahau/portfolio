Your breath is the wondrous method of taking hold of your consciousness. As one religious community says in its rule, &quot;One should not lose oneself in mind-dispersion or in one&#39;s surroundings. Learn to practice breathing in order to regain control of body and mind, to practice mindfulness, and to develop concentration and wisdom.&quot;</p><p><strong>Every act is a rite</strong></p><p>Chopping wood is meditation. Carrying water is meditation. Be mindful 24 hours a day, not just during the one hour you may allot for formal meditation. Each act must be carried out in mindfulness. Each act is a rite, a ceremony. Raising your cup of tea to your mouth is a rite. Does the word &quot;rite&quot; seem too solemn? I use that word in order to jolt you into the realization of the life-and-death matter of awareness.</p><p><strong>Mindfulness of the mind</strong></p><p>To take hold of our minds and calm our thoughts, we must also practice mindfulness of our feelings and perceptions. To take hold of your mind, you must practice mindfulness of the mind. You must know how to observe and recognize the presence of every feeling and thought which arises in you. If you want to know your own mind, there is only one way: to observe and recognize everything about it. This must be done at all times, during your day-to-day life no less than during the hour of meditation.</p><p>During meditation, various feelings and thoughts may arise. If you don&#39;t practice mindfulness of the breath, these thoughts will soon lure you away from mindfulness. But the breath isn&#39;t simply a means by which to chase away such thoughts and feelings. Breath remains the vehicle to unite body and mind and to open the gate to wisdom. When a feeling or thought arises, your intention should not be to chase it away, even if by continuing to concentrate on the breath the feeling or thought passes naturally from the mind. The intention isn&#39;t to chase it away, hate it, worry about it, or be frightened by it. So what exactly should you be doing concerning such thoughts and feelings? Simply acknowledge their presence. For example, when a feeling of sadness arises, immediately recognize it: &quot;A feeling of sadness has just arisen in me.&quot; If the feeling of sadness continues, continue to recognize &quot;A feeling of sadness is still in me.&quot; If there is a thought like, &quot;It&#39;s late, but the neighbors are surely making a lot of noise,&quot; recognize that the thought has arisen. If the thought continues to exist, continue to recognize it. If a different feeling or thought arises, recognize it in the same manner. The essential thing is not to let any feeling or thought arise without recognizing it in mindfulness, like a palace guard who is aware of every face that passes through the front corridor.</p><p><strong>Exercises in mindfulness</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Half-smile when you first wake up in the morning</em>. Hang a branch, any other sign, or even the word &quot;smile&quot; on the ceiling or wall so that you see it right away when you open your eyes. This sign will serve as your reminder. Use these seconds before you get out of bed to take hold of your breath. Inhale and exhale three breaths gently while maintaining the half smile. Follow your breaths.</p></li><li><p><em>Half-smile during your free moments</em>. Anywhere you find yourself sitting or standing, half-smile. Look at a child, a leaf, a painting on the wall, anything which is relatively still, and smile. Inhale and exhale quietly three times. Maintain the half smile and consider the spot of your attention as your own true nature.</p></li><li><p><em>Half-smile when irritated</em>. When you realize you&#39;re irritated, half-smile at once. Inhale and exhale quietly, maintaining the half smile for three breaths.</p></li><li><p><em>Following your breath while carrying on a conversation</em>. Breathe long, light, and even breaths. Follow your breath while listening to a friend&#39;s words and to your own replies.</p></li><li><p><em>Mindfulness of the positions of the body</em>. This can be practiced in any time and place. Begin to focus your attention on your breath. Breathe quietly and more deeply than usual. Be mindful of the position of your body, whether you are walking, standing, standing, lying, or sitting down. Know where you walk; where you stand; where you lie; where you sit. Be mindful of the purpose of your position. For example, you might be conscious that you are standing on a green hillside in order to refresh yourself, to practice breathing, or just to stand. If there is no purpose, be mindful that there is no purpose.</p></li><li><p><em>Washing the dishes</em>. Wash the dishes relaxingly, as though each bowl is an object of contemplation. Consider each bowl as sacred. Follow your breath to prevent your mind from straying. Do not try to hurry to get the job over with. Consider washing the dishes the most important thing in life. Washing the dishes is meditation. If you cannot wash the dishes in mindfulness, neither can you meditate while sitting in silence.</p></li><li><p><em>Compassion for the person you hate or despise the most</em>. Sit quietly. Breathe and smile the half smile. Contemplate the image of the person who has caused you the most suffering. Regard the features you hate or despise the most or find the most repulsive. Try to examine what makes this person happy and what causes suffering in his daily life. Contemplate the person&#39;s perceptions; try to see what patterns of though and reason this person follows. Examine what motivates this person&#39;s hopes and actions. Finally consider the person&#39;s consciousness. See whether his views and insights are open and free or not, and whether or not he has been influenced by any prejudices, narrow-mindedness, hatred, or anger. See whether or not he is master of himself. Continue until you feel compassion rise in your heart like a well filling with fresh water and your anger and resentment disappear. Practice this exercise many times on the same person.</p></li></ul></section></main></div></body></html>

**BUILDING A ROCK-SOLID ROUTINE**

- **GREAT WORK BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE**
  Do your most meaningful creative work at the beginning of your day, and leave "reactive work"--like responding to e-mail or other messages--for later.

- **JUMP-START YOUR CREATIVITY**
  Establish "associative triggers"--such as listening to the same music or arranging your desk in a certain way--that tell your mind it's time to get down to work.

- **FEEL THE FREQUENCY**
  Commit to working on your project at consistent intervals--ideally every day--to build creative muscle and momentum over time.

- **PULSE AND PAUSE**
  Move rhythmically between spending and renewing your energy by working in ninety-minute bursts and then taking a break.

- **GET LONELY**
  Make a point of spending some time alone each day. It's a way to observe unproductive habits and thought processes, and to calm your mind.

- **DON'T WAIT FOR MOODS**
  Show up, whether you feel inspired or not.

**FINDING FOCUS IN A DISTRACTED WORLD**

- **DEFEND YOUR CREATIVE TIME**
  Book time on your calendar for uninterrupted, focused work--and respect those blocks of time as you would any client meeting.

- **FOCUS WHEN YOU'RE FRESH**
  Tackle the projects that require "hard focus" early in your day. Self-control--and our ability to resist distractions--declines as the day goes on.

- **KILL THE BACKGROUND NOISE**
  Turn off your phone, e-mail, and any apps unrelated to your task. Even the presence of background activity (and temptation) can drain your focus.

- **MAKE PROGRESS VISIBLE**
  Marking progress is a huge motivator for long-term projects. Make your daily achievements visible by saving iterations, posting milestones, or keeping a daily journal.

- **GIVE YOUR BRAIN A BREAK**
  Alternate challenging creative work with more "mindless" tasks to give your brain time to rest and refuel.

- **TAP INTO TRANSITIONAL MOMENTS**
  Take a break from checking your smartphone during transitional moments, and open yourself up to opportunity and serendipity.

**TAMING YOUR TOOLS**

- **KEEP THE LONG VIEW IN VIEW**
  Post your complex, long-term goals by your workstation to keep them top of mind when prioritizing your tasks.

- **BE CONSCIOUS OF YOUR BANDWIDTH**
  Practice letting go of certain e-mail and social media conversations. There will always be more opportunities than you actually can take on.

- **CHECK YOURSELF, OR WRECK YOURSELF**
  Distinguish between compulsive and conscious behaviors. Are you acting out of boredom or blind habit when you could be serving a higher goal?

- **HIT THE RESET BUTTON**
  Make a ritual of unplugging on a regular basis. Turning everything off is like hitting the "reset" button on your mind--it gives you a fresh start.

- **DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH**
  Be conscious of your body. Breathing deeply and regularly can decrease your stress levels and help you make better decisions.

- **IN IMAGINATION WE TRUST**
  Don't trust technology over your own instincts and imagination. Doing busywork is easy; doing your best work is hard.

**SHARPENING YOUR CREATIVE MIND**

- **PRACTICE UNNECESSARY CREATION**
  Use personal creative projects to explore new obsessions, skills, or ways of working in a low-pressure environment.

- **WANDER LONELY AS A CLOUD**
  Make time for your mind--and body--to wander when you're stuck. Disengaging from the problem allows your subconscious to do its work.

- **DEFINE "FINISHED" FROM THE START**
  Keep your inner perfectionist in check by defining what finished looks like at the beginning of a project. And when you get there, stop!

- **DON'T GO ON AUTOPILOT**
  Repetition is the enemy of insight. Take unorthodox--even wacky--approaches to solving your stickiest problems and see what happens.

- **SEARCH FOR THE SOURCE**
  When the well runs dry, don't blame a lack of talent. Creative blocks frequently piggyback on other problems. See if you can identify them.

- **LOVE YOUR LIMITATIONS**
  Look at constraints as a benefit, rather than an impediment. They activate our creative thinking by upping the ante.

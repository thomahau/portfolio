Like the savage, the attitude of these men was stoical in great things, childish in little things.

I caught myself looking at him in a fascinated sort of way.  He was certainly a handsome man--beautiful in the masculine sense.  And again, with never-failing wonder, I remarked the total lack of viciousness, or wickedness, or sinfulness in his face.  It was the face, I am convinced, of a man who did no wrong.  And by this I do not wish to be misunderstood.  What I mean is that it was the face of a man who either did nothing contrary to the dictates of his conscience, or who had no conscience.  I am inclined to the latter way of accounting for it.  He was a magnificent atavism, a man so purely primitive that he was of the type that came into the world before the development of the moral nature.  He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.

He had opened up for me the world of the real, of which I had known practically nothing and from which I had always shrunk.  I had learned to look more closely at life as it was lived, to recognize that there were such things as facts in the world, to emerge from the realm of mind and idea and to place certain values on the concrete and objective phases of existence.

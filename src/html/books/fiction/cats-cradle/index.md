"New knowledge is the most valuable commodity on earth. The more truth we have to work with, the richer we become."
 
As a Bokononist, of course, I would have agreed gaily to go anywhere anyone suggested. As Bokonon says: "Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God."
 
Busy, busy, busy, is what we Bokononists whisper whenever we think of how complicated and unpredictable the machinery of life really is.
 
"Busy, busy, busy." "Sir?" "It's what we Bokononists say," he said, "when we feel that a lot of mysterious things are going on."
 
"The people down there are poor enough and scared enough and ignorant enough to have some common sense!"
 
It was the belief of Bokonon that good societies could be built only by pitting good against evil, and by keeping the tension between the two high at all times.
 
"Truth was the enemy of the people, because the truth was so terrible, so Bokonon made it his business to provide the people with better and better lies."

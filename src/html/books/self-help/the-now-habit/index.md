**Focusing exercise**

Two minutes, three breaths at each step

- Letting go of the past
- Letting go of the future
- Centering in the present

As you begin to speak to yourself in a language that focuses on _results_ rather than _blame_, on _choice_ rather than _have to_, on what _is_ rather than what you think _should be_, you will find that your body and mind cooperate by providing a level of _positive energy_, without stress or anxiety, free from unnecessary struggles of the past and negative comparisons with the future.

Negative language: avoid "_have to_" and "_should_"

Positive language:

- I am going to the store
- I will be at the dentist at 3 PM
- I am going to traffic court this morning

**Replacing negative attitudes**

- Replace "I have to" by "**I choose to**" in your inner dialogue
- Replace "I must finish" with "**When can I start?**" Focuses energy on what can be tackled now
- Replace "This is so big" with "**I can take one small step**"
- Replace "I must be perfect" with "**I can be human.**" Add _acceptance of_ (not _resignation to_) your human limits
- Procrastinator: "I have to finish something big and do it perfectly while working hard for long periods of time without time to play." Producer: "**I choose to start on one small imperfect step knowing I have plenty of time for play**"

"Putting off living" is the most tragic form of procrastination we can engage in. Not only does it keep us from completing the really important tasks in life, it lessens our respect for ourselves.

Three major blocks to action

- Fear of being overwhelmed
- Fear of failure
- Fear of finishing

All large tasks are completed in a series of starts: keep on starting, and finishing will take care of itself.

Thirty minutes can be all the time in the world to solve a problem when you are intensely focused. The important thing is that _you got started_.

Before deciding to go to a recreational activity or social commitment, take time out for just thirty minutes of quality work.

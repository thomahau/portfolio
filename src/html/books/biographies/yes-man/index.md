I became the man who could wriggle out of any prior engagement. Who could spot an invitation coming a mile off and head it off at the pass. The man who'd gladly swap a night down the pub for just one whiff of an episode of EastEnders. The man who'd send an e-mail instead of attend a birthday. Who'd text instead of call, and call instead of visit. I became the man who'd white-lie. The man who always had an excuse. The man who always said no.

I, Danny Wallace, being of sound mind and body, do hereby write this manifesto for my life. I swear I will be more open to opportunity. I swear I will live my life taking every available chance. I swear I will say Yes to every favour, request, suggestion and invitation – the little things that come our way every day. I SWEAR THAT HENCEFORTH, I WILL SAY YES WHERE ONCE I WOULD HAVE SAID NO.

A closed mind is a disease. You need to have an open mind otherwise life will just pass you by. You'll be an observer, rather than a participant.

‘I suppose in some ways all this is about confronting fears. People sometimes go through their lives having fears and never realising they can be removed in just a few minutes, for ever. People are always saying No to things, aren't they? They're frightened of change, used to routine, used to doing things a certain way. Like, the people who take risks in business are the people who don't fear change and, ultimately, they're the most successful.'

When you think about it, probably some of the best things that have ever happened to you in life, happened because you said Yes to something. Otherwise, things just sort of stay the same.

‘If we have faith that some higher powers, some enlightened beings, are helping us to develop spiritually, then you begin to relate to life completely differently. And I suppose life starts to become a little more magical. Every opportunity must be seen as a chance to learn. We have to be open to whatever happens, good or bad. Because anything that happens is a chance to increase our wisdom, and to walk further down the path to enlightenment.‘

‘Si a Todo. It means "Yes To Everything". It's Spanish.'

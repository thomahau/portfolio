                <p>No matter how mundane some action might appear, keep at it long enough and it becomes a contemplative, even meditative act.</p>
<p>In private correspondence the great mystery writer Raymond Chandler once confessed that even if he didn&#39;t write anything, he made sure he sat down at his desk every single day and concentrated. I understand the purpose behind his doing this. This is the way Chandler gave himself the physical stamina a professional writer needs, quietly strengthening his willpower. This sort of daily training was indispensable to him. Writing novels, to me, is basically a kind of manual labor.</p>
<p>To deal with something unhealthy, a person needs to be as healthy as possible. That&#39;s my motto. In other words, an unhealthy soul requires a healthy body. This might sound paradoxical, but it&#39;s something I&#39;ve felt very keenly ever since I became a professional writer. The healthy and the unhealthy are not necessarily at opposite ends of the spectrum. They don&#39;t stand in opposition to each other, but rather complement each other, and in some cases even band together.</p>
<p>As I suspect is true of many who write for a living, as I write I think about all sorts of things. I don&#39;t necessarily write down what I&#39;m thinking; it&#39;s just that as I write I think about things. As I write, I arrange my thoughts. And rewriting and revising takes my thinking down even deeper paths. No matter how much I write, though, I never reach a conclusion. And no matter how much I rewrite, I never reach the destination. Even after decades of writing, the same still holds true. All I do is present a few hypotheses or paraphrase the issue. Or find an analogy between the structure of the problem and something else.</p>

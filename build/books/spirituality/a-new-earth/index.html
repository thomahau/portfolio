<p>At the heart of the new consciousness is the transcendence of thought, the newfound ability of rising above thought, of realizing a dimension within yourself that is infinitely more vast than thought. You then no longer derive your identity, your sense of who you are, from the incessant stream of thinking that in the old consciousness you take to be yourself. What a liberation to realize that the &quot;voice in my head&quot; is not who I am. Who am I then? The one who sees that. The awareness that is prior to thought, the space in which the thought – or the emotion or sense perception – happens.</p>
<p>The quicker you are in attaching verbal or mental labels to things, people, or situations, the more shallow and lifeless your reality becomes, and the more deadened you become to reality, the miracle of life that continuously unfolds within and around you. In this way, cleverness may be gained, but wisdom is lost, and so are joy, love, creativity, and aliveness. They are concealed in the still gap between the perception and the interpretation. Of course we have to use words and thoughts. They have their own beauty – but do we need to become imprisoned in them?</p>
<p>As a spiritual practice, I suggest that you investigate your relationship with the world of things through selfobservation, and in particular, things that are designated with the word &quot;my.&quot; You need to be alert and honest to find out, for example, whether your sense of selfworth is bound up with things you possess. Do certain things induce a subtle feeling of importance or superiority? Does the lack of them make you feel inferior to others who have more than you? Do you casually mention things you own or show them off to increase your sense of worth in someone else&#39;s eyes and through them in your own? Do you feel resentful or angry and somehow diminished in your sense of self when someone else has more than you or when you lose a prized possession?</p>
<p>Equating the physical senseperceived body that is destined to grow old, wither, and die with &quot;I&quot; always leads to suffering sooner or later. To refrain from identifying with the body doesn&#39;t mean that you neglect, despise, or no longer care for it. If it is strong, beautiful, or vigorous, you can enjoy and appreciate those attributes – while they last. You can also improve the body&#39;s condition through right nutrition and exercise. If you don&#39;t&#39; equate the body with who you are, when beauty fades, vigor diminishes, or the body becomes incapacitated, this will not affect your sense of worth or identity in any way. In fact, as the body begins to weaken, the formless dimension, the light of consciousness, can shine more easily through the fading form.</p>
<p>The conceptual &quot;I&quot; cannot survive without the conceptual &quot;other.&quot; The others are most other when I see them as my enemies. At one end of this scale of this unconscious egoic pattern lies the egoic compulsive habit of faultfinding and complaining about others. Jesus referred to it when he said, &quot;Why to do you see the speck that is in your brother&#39;s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?&quot; At the other end of the scale, there is physical violence between individuals and warfare between nations. In the Bible, Jesus&#39; question remains unanswered, but the answer is, of course: Because when I criticize or condemn another, it makes me feel bigger, superior.</p>
<p><strong>COMPLAINING AND RESENTMENT</strong>
Complaining is one of the ego&#39;s favorite strategies for strengthening itself. Every complaint is a little story the mind makes up that you completely believe in. Whether you complain aloud or only in thought makes no difference. Some egos that perhaps don&#39;t have much else to identify with easily survive on complaining alone. When you are in the grip of such and ego, complaining, especially about other people, is habitual and, of course, unconscious, which means you don&#39;t know what you are doing. Applying negative mental labels to people, either to their face or more commonly when you speak about them to others or even just think about them, is often part of this pattern.</p>
<p>Resentment is the emotion that goes with complaining and the mental labeling of people and adds even more energy to the ego. Resentment means to feel bitter, indignant, aggrieved, or offended. You resent other people&#39;s greed, their dishonesty, their lack of integrity, what they are doing what they did in the past, what they said what they failed to do, what they should for shouldn&#39;t have done. The ego loves it. Instead of overlooking unconsciousness in others, you make it in to their identity. Who is doing that? The unconsciousness in you, the ego. Sometimes the &quot;fault&quot; that you perceive in another isn&#39;t even there. It is a total misinterpretation, a projection by a mind conditioned to see enemies and to make itself right or superior. At other times, the fault may be theirs, but by focusing on it, sometimes to the exclusion of everything else, you amplify it. And what you react to in another, you strengthen in yourself.</p>
<p>The ego loves to complain and feel resentful not only abut other people but also about situations. What you can do to a person, you can also do to a situation: make it into an enemy. The implication is always: This should not be happening; I don&#39;t want to be here; I don&#39;t want to be doing this; I&#39;m being treated unfairly. And the egos greatest enemy of all is, of course, the present moment, which is to say, life itself. Complaining is not to be confused with informing someone of a mistake or deficiency so that it can be put right. And to refrain from complaining doesn&#39;t necessarily mean putting up with bad quality or behavior. There is no ego in telling the waiter that your soup is cold and needs to be heated up – if you stick to the facts, which are always neutral. &quot;How dare you serve me cold soup...&quot; That&#39;s complaining. There is a &quot;me&quot; here that loves to feel personally offended by the cold soup and is going to make the most of it, a &quot;me&quot; that enjoys making someone wrong. The complaining we are talking about is in the service of the ego, not of change. Sometimes it becomes obvious that the ego doesn&#39;t really want change so that it can go on complaining. See if you can catch, that is to say, notice, the voice in the head, perhaps in the very moment it complains about something, and recognize it for what it is: the voice of the ego, no more than a conditioned mindpattern, a thought. Whenever you notice that voice, you will also realize that you are not the voice, but the one who is aware of it. In fact, you are the awareness that is aware of the voice. In the background, there is the awareness. In the foreground, there is the voice, the thinker. In this way you are becoming free of the ego, free of the unobserved mind. The moment you become aware of the ego in you, it is strictly speaking no longer the ego, but just an old, conditioned mindpattern. Ego implies unawareness. Awareness and ego cannot coexist. The old mindpattern or mental habit may still survive and reoccur for a while because it has the momentum of thousands of years of collective human unconsciousness behind it, but every time it is recognized, it is weakened.</p>
<p>There are many people who are always waiting for the next thing to react against, to feel annoyed or disturbed about – and it never takes long before they find it. &quot;This is an outrage,&quot; they say. &quot;How dare you...&quot; &quot; I resent this.&quot; They are addicted to upset and anger as others are to a drug. Through reacting against this or that they assert and strengthen their feeling of self.</p>
<p><strong>BEING RIGHT, MAKING WRONG</strong>
Complaining as well as faultfinding and reactivity strengthen the ego&#39;s sense of boundary and separateness on which tis survival depends. But they also strengthen the ego in another way by giving it a feeling of superiority on which it thrives. It may not be immediately apparent how complaining, say, about a traffic jam, about politicians, about the &quot;greedy wealthy&quot; or the &quot;lazy unemployed,&quot; or your colleagues or exspouse , men or women, can give you a sense of superiority. Here is why. When you complain, by implication you are right and the person or situation you complain about or react against is wrong.</p>
<p>Every ego confuses opinions and viewpoints with facts. Furthermore, it cannot tell the differences between an event and its reaction to that event. Every ego is a master of selective perception and distorted interpretation. Only through awareness – not through thinking – can you differentiate between fact and opinion. Only through awareness are you able to see: There is the situation and here is the anger I feel about it, and then realize there are other ways of approaching the situation, other ways of seeing it and dealing with it. Only through awareness can you see th totality of the situation or person instead of adopting one limited perspective.</p>
<p><strong>DO YOU WANT PEACE OR DRAMA?</strong>
You want peace. There is no one who does not want peace. Yet there is something else in you that wants the drama, wants the conflict. You may not be able to feel it at this moment. You may have to wait for a situation or even just a thought that triggers a reaction in you: someone accusing you of this or that, not acknowledging you, encroaching on your territory, questioning the way you do things, an argument about money.... Can you then feel the enormous surge of force moving through you, the fear, perhaps being masked by anger or hostility? Can you hear your own voice becoming harsh or shrill, or louder and a few octaves lower? Can you be aware of your mind racing to defend its position, justify, attack, blame? In other words, can you awaken at that moment of unconsciousness? Can you feel that there is something in you that is at war, something that feels threatened and wants to survive at all cost, that needs the drama in order to assert its identity as the victorious character within that theatrical production? Can you feel there is something in you that would rather be right than at peace?</p>
<p><strong>THE EGO&#39;S NEED TO FEEL SUPERIOR</strong>
There are many subtle but easily overlooked forms of ego that you may observe in other people and, more important, in yourself. Remember: The moment you become aware of the go in yourself, that emerging awareness is who you are beyond ego, the deeper &quot;I.&quot; The recognition of the false is already the arising of the real. For example, you are about to tell someone the news of what happened. &quot;Guess what? You don&#39;t know yet? Let me tell you.&quot; If you are alert enough, present enough, you may be able to detect a momentary sense of satisfaction within yourself just before imparting the news, even if it is bad news. It is due to the fact that for a brief moment there is, in the eyes of the ego, an imbalance in your favor between you and the other person. For that brief moment, you know more than the other. The satisfaction that you feel is of the ego, and it is derived from feeling a stronger sense of self relative to the other person. Even if he or she is the president or the pope, you feel superior in that moment because you know more. Many people are addicted to gossiping partly for this reason. In addition, gossiping often carries an element of malicious criticism and judgment of others, and so it also strengthens the ego through the implied but imagined moral superiority that is there whenever you apply a negative judgment to anyone. If someone has more, knows more, or can do more than I, the ego feels threatened because the feeling of &quot;less&quot; diminishes its imagined sense of self relative to the other. It may then try to restore itself by somehow diminishing, criticizing, or belittling the value of the other person&#39;s possessions, knowledge, or abilities. Or the ego may shift its strategy, and instead of competing with the other person, it will enhance itself by association with that person, if he or she is important in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>Whenever you feel superior or inferior to anyone, that&#39;s the ego in you.</p>
<p>I usually congratulate people when they tell me, &quot;I don&#39;t know who I am anymore.&quot; Then they look perplexed and ask, &quot;Are you saying it is a good thing to be confused?&quot; I ask them to investigate. What does it mean to be confused? &quot;I don&#39;t know &quot; is not confusion. Confusion is: &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I should know&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I need to know.&quot; is it possible to let go of the belief that you should or need to know who you are? In other words, can you cease looking to conceptual definitions to give you a sense of self? Can you cease looking to  thought for an identity? When you let go of the belief that you should or need to know who you are, what happens to confusion? Suddenly it is gone. When you fully accept that you don&#39;t know, you actually enter a state of peace and clarity that is closer to who you truly are than thought could ever be. Defining yourself through thought is limiting yourself.</p>
<p><strong>GIVING UP ROLEPLAYING</strong>
A range of conditioned patterns of behavior come into effect between two human beings that determine the nature of the interaction. Instead of human beings, conceptual mental images are interacting with each other. the more identified people are with their respective roles, the more inauthentic the relationships become.</p>
<p>You have a mental image not only of who the other person is, but also of who you are, especially in relation to the person you are interacting with. So you are not relating with that person oat all, but who you think you are is relating to who you think the other person is and vice versa. The conceptual image your mind has made of yourself is relating to its own creation, which is the conceptual image it has made of the other person. The other person&#39;s mind has probably done the same, so very egoic interaction between tow people is in reality the interaction between for conceptual mindmade entities that are ultimately fictions. It is therefore not surprising there is so much conflict in relationships. There is no true relationship.</p>
<p>To do whatever is required of you in any situation without it becoming a role that you identify with is an essential lesson in the art of living that each one of us is here to learn. You become most powerful in whatever you do if the action is performed for its own sake rather than as a means to protect, enhance, or conform to your role identity. Every role is a fictitious sense of self, and through it everything becomes personalized and thus corrupted and distorted by the mindmade &quot;little me&quot; and whatever role it happens to be playing.</p>
<p>When you don&#39;t play roles, it means there is no self (ego) in what you do. There is no secondary agenda: protection or strengthening of yourself. As a result, your actions have far greater power. You are totally focused on the situation. You become one with it. You don&#39;t try to be anybody in particular. You are most powerful, most effective, when you are completely yourself. But don&#39;t try to be yourself That&#39;s another role. It&#39;s called &quot;natural, spontaneous me.&quot; As soon as yo are trying to be this or that, you are playing a role. &quot;Just be yourself&quot; is good advice, but it can also be misleading. the mind will come in and say, &quot;Let&#39;s see. How can I be myself?&quot; Then, the mind will develop some kind of strategy: &quot;How to be myself.&quot; Another role. &quot;How can I be myself?&quot; is, in fact, the wrong yourself. It implies you have to do something to be yourself. But how doesn&#39;t apply here because you are yourself already. Just stop adding unnecessary baggage to who you already are. &quot;But I don&#39;t know who I am. I don&#39;t know what it means to be myself.&quot; If you can be absolutely comfortable with not knowing who you are, then what&#39;s left is who you are – the Being behind the human, a field of pure potentiality other than something that is already defined.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING YOURSELF</strong>
If there is unhappiness in you, first you need to acknowledge that it is there. But don&#39;t say, &quot;I&#39;m unhappy.&quot; Unhappiness has nothing to do with who you are. Say: &quot;There is unhappiness in me.&quot; Then investigate it. A situation you find yourself in may have something to do with it. Action may be required to change the situation or remove yourself from it. If there is nothing you can do, face what is and say, &quot;Well, right now, this is how it is. I can either accept it, or make myself miserable.&quot; The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it. Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking. Separate them from the situation, which is always neutral, which always is as it is. There is the situation or the fact, and here are my thoughts about it. Instead of making up stories, stay with the facts. For example, &quot;I am ruined&quot; is a story. It limits you and prevents you from taking effective action. &quot;I have fifty cents left in my bank account&quot; is a fact. Facing facts is always empowering. Be aware that what you think, to a large extent, creates the emotions that you feel. See the link between your thinking and your emotions. Rather than being your thoughts and emotions, be the awareness behind them.</p>
<p>&quot;If you think you are so enlightened,&quot; Ram Dass said, &quot;go and spend a week with your parents.&quot; That is good advice. The relationship with your parents is not only the primordial relationship hat sets the tone for all subsequent relationships, it is also a good test for your degree of Presence. The more shared past there is in a relationship, the more present you need to be; otherwise, you will be forced to relive the past again and again.</p>
<p>Give up defining yourself – to yourself or to others. You won&#39;t die. You will come to life. And don&#39;t be concerned with how others define you. When they define you, they are limiting themselves, so it&#39;s their problem. Whenever you interact with people, don&#39;t be there primarily as a function or a role, but as a field of conscious Presence.</p>
<p><strong>NEGATIVITY</strong>
Whenever you are in a negative state, there is something in you that wants the negativity, that perceives it as pleasurable, or that believes it will get you what you want. Otherwise, who would want to hang on to negativity, make themselves and others miserable, and create disease in the body? So, whenever there is negativity n you, if you can be aware at that moment that there is something in you that takes pleasure in it or believes it has a useful purpose you are becoming aware of the ego directly. The moment this happens, your identity has shifted from ego to awareness. This means the ego is shrinking and awareness is growing.</p>
<p>If in the midst of negativity you are able to realize &quot;At this moment I am creating suffering form myself&quot; it will be enough to raise you above the limitations of conditioned egoic states and reactions. It will open up infinite possibilities which come to you when there is awareness  other vastly more intelligent ways of dealing with any situation. You will be free to let go of your unhappiness the moment you recognize it as unintelligent. Negativity is not intelligent. It is always of the ego. The ego may be clever, but it is not intelligent. Cleverness pursues its own little aims. Intelligence sees the larger whole in which all things are connected. Cleverness is motivated by selfinterest, and it is extremely shortsighted. Most politicians and businesspeople are clever. Very few are intelligent. Whatever is attained through cleverness is shortlived and always turns out to be eventually self defeating. Cleverness divides; intelligence unites.</p>
<p><strong>THE BACKGROUND UNHAPPINESS</strong>
The ego creates separation, and separation creates suffering. The ego is therefore clearly pathological. Apart from the obvious ones such as anger, hatred, and so on, there are other more subtle forms of negativity that are so common they are usually not recognized as sch, for example, impatience, irritation, nervousness, and being &quot;fed up.&quot; They constitute the background unhappiness that is many people&#39;s predominant inner state. You need to be extremely alert and absolutely present to be able to detect them. Whenever you do, it is a moment of awakening, of disidentification from the mind. Here is one of the most common negative states that is easily overlooked, precisely because it is so common, so normal. You may be familiar with it. Do you often experience a feeling of discontent that could best be described as a kind of background resentment? It may be either specific or nonspecific. Many people spend a large part of their lives in that state. They are so identified with it that they cannot stand back and see it. Underlying that feeling are certain unconsciously held beliefs, that is to say, thoughts. You think these thoughts in the same way that you dream your dreams when you are asleep. In other words, you don&#39;t know you are thinking those thoughts, just as the dreamer doesn&#39;t know he is dreaming.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common unconscious thoughts that feed the feeling of discontent or background resentment. I have stripped away the content from those thoughts so that the bare structure remains. They become more clearly visible that way. Whenever there is unhappiness in the background of your life (or even in the foreground), you can see which of these thoughts applies and fill in your own content according to your personal situation:</p>
<p><em>&quot;There is something that needs to happen in my life before I can be at peace (happy, fulfilled, etc.). And I resent that it hasn&#39;t happened yet. Maybe my resentment will  finally make it happen.&quot; &quot;Something happened in the past that should not have happened, and I resent that. If that hadn&#39;t happened, I would be at peace now.&quot; &quot;Something is happening now that should not be happening, and it is preventing me from being at peace now.&quot;</em> </p>
<p>Often the unconscious beliefs are directed toward a person and so &quot;happening&quot; becomes &quot;doing&quot;:</p>
<p><em>&quot;You should do this or that so that I can be at peace. And I resent that you haven&#39;t done it yet. Maybe my resentment will make you do it.&quot; &quot;Something you (or I) did, said, or failed to do in the past is preventing me from being at peace now.&quot; &quot;What you are doing or failing to do now is preventing me from being at peace.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS</strong>
All of the above are assumptions, unexamined thoughts that are confused with reality. They are stories the ego crates to convince you that you cannot be at peace now or cannot be fully yourself now. Being at peace and being who you are, that is, being yourself, are one.The ego says: Maybe at some point in the future, I can be at peace – and if this, that, or the other happens, or I obtain this or become that. Or it says: I can never be at peace because of something that happened in the past. Listen to people&#39;s stories and they could all be entitled &quot;Why I Cannot Be At Peace Now.&quot; The ego doesn&#39;t know that your only opportunity for being at peace is now. Or maybe it does know, and it is afraid that you may find this out. Peace, after all, is the end of the ego. How to be at peace now? By making peace with the present moment. The present moment is the field on which he game of life happens. It cannot happen anywhere else. Once you have made peace with the present moment, see what happens,  what you can do or choose to do, or rather what life does through you. There are three words that convey the secret of the art of living, the secret of all success and happiness: One With Life. Being one with life is bing one with Now. You then realize that you don&#39;t live your life, but life lives you. Life is the dancer, and you are the dance.</p>
<p>To end the misery that has afflicted the human condition for thousands of years, you have to start with yourself and take responsibility for your inner state at any given moment. That means now. Ask yourself, &quot;Is there negativity an me at this moment?&quot; Then, become alert, attentive to your thoughts as well as your emotions. Watch out for the lowlevel unhappiness in whatever form at hat I mentioned earlier, such as discontent, nervousness, being &quot;fed up,&quot; and so on. Watch out for thoughts that appear to justify or explain this unhappiness but in reality cause it. The moment you become aware of a negative state within yourself, it does not mean you have failed. It means that you have succeeded. until that awareness happens, there is identification with inner states, and such identification is ego. With awareness comes disidentification from thoughts, emotions, and reactions. This is not to be confused with denial. The thoughts, emotions, or reactions are recognized, and in the moment of recognizing, disidentification happens automatically. Your sense of self, of who you are, then undergoes a shift: Before you were the thoughts, emotions and reactions; now you are the awareness, the conscious Presence that witnesses those states.</p>
<p><strong>GRATITUDE</strong>
The world always makes sure that you cannot fool yourself for long about who you really think you are by showing you what truly matters to you. How you react to people and situations, especially when challenges arise, is the best indicator of how deeply you know yourself. The more limited, the more narrowly egoic the view of yourself, the more you will see, focus on, and react to the egoic limitations, the unconsciousness in others. Their &quot;faults&quot; or what you perceive as their faults become to you their identity. His means you will see only the ego in them and thus strengthen the ego in yourself. Instead of looking &quot;through&quot; the ego in others, you are looking &quot;at&quot; the ego. Who is looking at the ego? The ego in you.</p>
<p>Rather than acknowledge the good that is already in your life, all you see is lack. Acknowledging the good that is already in your life is the foundation for all abundance. The fact is: Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you are withholding from the world. You are withholding it because deep down you think you are small and that you have nothing to give.</p>
<p>Try this for a couple of weeks and see how it changes your reality: Whatever you think people are withholding from you  praise, appreciation, assistance, loving care, and so on – give it to them. You don&#39;t have it? Just act as if you had it, and it will come. Then, soon after you start giving, you will start receiving. You cannot receive what you don&#39;t give. Outflow determines inflow. Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you already have, but unless you allow it to flow out, you won&#39;t even know that you have it. This includes abundance.</p>
<p>The source of all abundance is not outside you. It is part of who you are. However, start by acknowledging and recognizing abundance without. See the fullness of life all around you. The warmth of the sun on your skin, the display of magnificent flowers outside a florist&#39;s shop, biting into a succulent fruit, or getting soaked in an abundance of water falling from the sky. The fullness of life is there at every step. The acknowledgment of that abundance that is all around you awakens the dormant abundance within. Then let it flow out. When you smile at a a stranger, there is already a minute outflow of energy. You become a giver. Ask yourself often: &quot;What can I give here; how can I be of service to this person, this situation.&quot; You don&#39;t need to own anything to feel abundant, although if you feel abundant consistently things will almost certainly come to you. Abundance comes only to those who already have it.</p>
<p><strong>THE PRESENT MOMENT</strong>
A vital question to ask yourself frequently is: What is my relationship with the present moment? Then become alert to find out the answer. Am I treating the Now as no more than a means to an end? Do I see it as an obstacle? Am I making it into an enemy? Since the present moment is all you ever have, since Life is inseparable from the Now, what the question really means is: What is my relationship with Life? This question is an excellent way of unmasking the ego in you and bringing you into the state of Presence. Although the question doesn&#39;t embody the absolute truth (Ultimately, I and the present moment are one), it is a useful pointer in the right direction. Ask yourself it often until you don&#39;t need it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>DIMINISHMENT OF EGO</strong>
A powerful spiritual practice is consciously to allow the diminishment of ego when it happens without attempting to restore it. I recommend that you experiment with this from time to time. For example, when someone criticizes you, blames you, or calls you names, instead of immediately retaliating or defending yourself – do nothing. Allow the selfimage to remain diminished and become alert to what that feels like deep inside you. For a few seconds, it may feel uncomfortable, as if you had shrunk in size. Then you may sense an inner spaciousness that feels intensely alive. You haven&#39;t been diminished at all. In fact, you have expanded. You may then come to an amazing realization: When you are seemingly diminished in some way and remain in absolute nonreaction, not just externally but also internally, you realize that nothing real has been diminished, that through becoming &quot;less,&quot; you become more. When you no longer defend or attempt to strengthen the form of yourself, you step out of identification with form, with mental selfimage. Through becoming less (in the ego&#39;s perception), you in fact undergo an expansion and make room for Being to come forward. True power, who you are beyond form, can then shine through the apparently weakened form. this is what Jesus means when he says, &quot;Deny yourself&quot; or &quot;Turn the other cheek.&quot; This does not mean, of course, that you invite abuse or turn yourself into a victim of unconscious people. Sometimes a situation may demand that you tell someone to &quot;back off&quot; in no uncertain terms. Without egoic defensiveness, there will be power behind your words, yet no reactive force. If necessary, you can also say not to someone firmly and clearly, and it will be what I call a &quot;highquality no&quot; that is free of all negativity.</p>
<p><strong>THIS, TOO, WILL PASS</strong>
The words  are not telling you that you should not enjoy the good in your life, nor are they merely meant to provide some comfort in times of suffering. They have a deeper purpose: to make you aware of the fleetingness of every situation, which is due to the transience of all forms – good or bad. When you become aware of the transience of all forms, your attachment to them lessens, and you disidentify from them to some extent. Being detached does not mean that you cannot enjoy the good that the world has to offer. In fact, you enjoy it more. Once you see and accept the transience of all things and the inevitability of change, you can enjoy the pleasures of the world while they last without fear of loss or anxiety about the future. When you are detached, you gain a higher vantage point from which to view the events in your life instead of being trapped inside them.</p>
<p>Whenever you are upset about an event, a person, or a situation, the real cause is not the event, person, or situation but a loss of true perspective that only space can provide. You are trapped in object consciousness, unaware of the timeless inner space of consciousness itself. The words <em>This, too, will pass</em> when used as a pointer can restore awareness of that dimension to you. Another pointer to the truth in you is contained in he following statement: &quot;I am never upset for the reason I think.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>NAMING AND INTERPRETING REALITY</strong>
This is most people&#39;s reality: As soon as something is perceived, it is named, interpreted, compared with something else, liked, disliked, or called good or bad by the phantom self, the ego. They are imprisoned in thought forms, in object consciousness. You do not awaken spiritually until the compulsive and unconscious naming ceases, or at least you become aware of it and thus are able to observe it as it happens. It is through this constant naming that the ego remains in place as the unobserved mind. Whenever it ceases and even when you just become aware of it, there is inner space, and you are not possessed by the mind anymore. Choose an object close to you – a pen, a chair, a cup, a plant – and explore it visually, that is to say, look at it with great interest, almost curiosity. Avoid any objects with strong personal associations that remind you of the past, such as where you bought it, who gave it to you, and so on. Also avoid anything that has writing on it such as a book or a bottle. It would stimulate thought. Without straining, relaxed but alert, give your complete attention to the object, every detail of it. If thoughts arise, don&#39;t get involved in them. It is not the thoughts you are interested in, but the act of perception itself. Can you take the thinking out of the perceiving? Can you look without the voice in your head commenting, drawing conclusions, comparing, or trying to figure something out? After a couple of minutes or so, let your gaze wander around the room or wherever you are, your alert attention lighting up each thing that it rests upon. Then, listen to any sounds that may be present. Listen to them in the same way as you looked at the things around you. Some sounds may be natural – water, wind, birds – while others are manmade. Some may be pleasant, others unpleasant. However don&#39;t differentiate between good and bad. Allow each sound to be as it is, without interpretation. Here too, relaxed but alert attention is the key. When you look and listen tin this way, you may become aware of a subtle and at first perhaps a hardly noticeable sense of calm. Some people feel it as a stillness in the background. Others call it peace. When consciousness is no longer totally absorbed by thinking, some of it remains in its formless, unconditioned, original state. This is inner space.</p>
<p><strong>ADDICTION</strong>
If you have a compulsive behavior pattern such as smoking, overeating, drinking, TV watching, Internet addiction, or whatever it may be, this is what you can do: When you notice the compulsive need arising in you, stop and take three conscious breaths. This generates awareness. Then for a few minutes be aware of the compulsive urge itself as an energy field inside you. Consciously feel that need to physically or mentally ingest or consume a certain substance or the desire to act out some form of compulsive behavior. Then take a few more conscious breaths. After that you may find that the compulsive urge has disappeared   for the time being. or you may find that it still overpowers you, and you cannot help but indulge or act it out again. Don&#39;t make it into a problem. Make the addiction part of your awareness practice in the way described above. As awareness grows, addictive patterns will weaken and eventually dissolve. Remember, however, to catch any thoughts that justify the addictive behavior, sometimes with clever arguments, as they arise in you mind. Ask yourself, Who is talking here? And you will realize the addiction is talking. As long as you know that, as long as you are present as the observer of your mind, it is less likely to trick you into doing what it wants.</p>
<p><strong>AWARENESS</strong>
As much as possible in everyday life, use awareness of the inner body to create space. When waiting, when listening to someone, when pausing to look at the sky, a tree, a flower, your partner, or child, feel the aliveness within at the same time. This means part of your attention or consciousness remains formless, an the rest is available for the outer world of form. Whenever you &quot;inhabit&quot; your body in this way, it serves as an anchor for staying present in the Now. It prevents you from losing yourself in thinking, in emotions, or in external situations</p>
<p><strong>GREATNESS IN THE PRESENT</strong>
<em>My fear is that I will remain stuck with doing little things for the rest of my life, things that are of no consequence. I&#39;m afraid of never rising above mediocrity, never daring to achieve anything great, not fulfilling my potential.</em> The great arises out of small things that are honored and cared for. Everybody&#39;s life really consists of small things. Greatness is a mental abstraction and a favorite fantasy of the ego. The paradox is that the foundation for greatness is honoring the small things of the present moment instead of pursuing the idea of greatness. The present moment is always all in the sense that it is always simple, but concealed within it lies the greatest power. Like the atom, it is one of the smallest things yet contains enormous power. Only when you align yourself with the present moment do you have access to that power. Or it may be more true to say that it then has access to you and through you to this world.</p>
<p>So be true to life by being true to your inner purpose. As you become present and thereby total in what you do, your actions become charged with spiritual power. At first there may be no noticeable change in what you do – only the how changes. your primary purpose is now to enable consciousness to flow into what you do. The secondary purpose is whatever you want to achieve through the doing. Whereas the notion of purpose before was always associated with future, there is now a deeper purpose hat can only be found in the present, through the denial of time.</p>
<p>In any situation and in whatever you do, your state of consciousness is the primary factor; the situation and what you do is secondary. &quot;Future&quot; success is dependent upon and inseparable from the consciousness out of which the actions emanate. That can be either the reactive force of the ego or the alert attention of awakened consciousness. All truly successful action comes out of that field of alert attention, rather than from ego and conditioned, unconscious thinking.</p>
<p><strong>AWAKENED DOING</strong>
The modalities of awakened doing are acceptance, enjoyment, and enthusiasm. Each one represents a certain vibrational frequency of consciousness. You need to be vigilant to make sure that one of them operates whenever you are engaged in doing anything at all – from the most simple task to the most complex. If you are not in the state of either acceptance, enjoyment, or enthusiasm, look closely and you will find that you are creating suffering for yourself and others.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong>
Whatever you cannot enjoy doing, you can at least accept that this is what you have to do. Acceptance means: For now, this is what this situation, this moment, requires me to do, and so I do it willingly. Performing an action in the state of acceptance means you are at peace while you do it. If you can neither enjoy or bring acceptance to what you do – stop. Otherwise, you are not taking responsibility for the only thing you can really take responsibility for, which also happens to be one thing that really matters: your state of consciousness. And if you are not taking responsibility for your state of consciousness, you are not taking responsibility for life.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoyment</strong>
The peace that comes with surrendered action turns to a sense of aliveness when you actually enjoy what you are doing. You don&#39;t have to wait for something &quot;meaningful&quot; to come into your life so that you can finally enjoy what you do. There is more meaning in joy than you will ever need. The &quot;waiting to start living&quot; syndrome is one of the most common delusions of the unconscious state. Expansion and positive change on the outer level is much more likely to come into your life if you  can enjoy what you are doing already, instead of waiting for some change so that you can start enjoying what you do. Don&#39;t ask your mind for permission to enjoy what you do. All you will get is plenty of reasons why you can&#39;t enjoy it. &quot;Not now,&quot; the mind will say. &quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy? There&#39;s no time. Maybe tomorrow you can start enjoying....&quot; That tomorrow will never come unless you begin enjoying what you are doing now.</p>
<p>Here is a spiritual practice that will bring empowerment and creative expansion into your life. Make a list of a number of everyday routine activities that you perform frequently. Include activities hat you may consider uninteresting, boring, tedious, irritating, or stressful. But don&#39;t include anything that you hate or detest doing. That&#39;s a case either for acceptance or for stopping what you do. The list may include traveling to and from work, buying groceries, doing your laundry, or anything that you find tedious or stressful in your daily work. Then, whenever you are engaged in those activities, let hem be a vehicle for alertness. Be absolutely present in what you do and sense the alert, alive stillness within you in the background of the activity. You will soon find that what you do in such a state of heightened awareness, instead of being stressful, tedious, or irritating, is actually becoming enjoyable. To be more precise, what you are enjoying is not really the outward action but the inner dimension of consciousness hat flows into the action. This is finding the joy of Being in what you are doing. If you feel your life lacks significance or is too stressful or tedious, it is because you haven&#39;t brought that dimension into your life yet. Being conscious in what you do has not yet become your main aim.</p>
<p><strong>Enthusiasm</strong>
Enthusiasm means there is deep enjoyment in what you do plus the added element of a goal or a vision that you work toward. A certain degree of what we might call structural tension is now added to enjoyment, and so it turns into enthusiasm. At the height of creative activity fueled by enthusiasm, there will be enormous intensity and energy behind what you do. You will feel like an arrow hat is moving toward the target – and enjoying the journey. To an onlooker, it may appear that you are under stress, but the intensity of enthusiasm has nothing to do with stress. When you want to arrive at your goal more than you want to be doing what you are doing, you become stressed. The balance between enjoyment and structural tension is lost, and the latter has won. When there is stress, it is usually a sign that the ego has returned , and you are cutting yourself off form the creative power of the universe. Instead, there is only the force and strain of egoic wanting, and so you have to struggle and &quot;work hard&quot; to make it. Stress always diminishes both the quality and effectiveness of what you do under its influence. There is also a strong link between stress and negative emotions, such as anxiety and anger.</p>

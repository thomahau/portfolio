                <p>The seeker is he who is in search of himself. Give up all questions except one: ‘Who am I?&#39; After all, the only fact you are sure of is that you are. The ‘I am&#39; is certain. The ‘I am this&#39; is not. Struggle to find out what you are in reality. To know what you are, you must first investigate and know what you are not. Discover all that you are not -- body, feelings, thoughts, time, space, this or that -- nothing, concrete or abstract, which you perceive can be you. The very act of perceiving shows that you are not what you perceive. The clearer you understand that on the level of mind you can be described in negative terms only, the quicker will you come to the end of your search and realize that you are the limitless being.</p>
<p><strong>Obsession with the Body</strong></p>
<p>My life is a succession of events, just like yours. Only I am detached and see the passing show as a passing show, while you stick to things and move along with them.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> All teachers advise to meditate. What is the purpose of meditation?</p>
<p><strong>Maharaj:</strong> We know the outer world of sensations and actions, but of our inner world of thoughts and feelings we know very little. The primary purpose of meditation is to become conscious of, and familiar with, our inner life. The ultimate purpose is to reach the source of life and consciousness. Incidentally, practice of meditation affects deeply our character. We are slaves to what we do not know: of what we know we are masters. Whatever vice or weakness in ourselves we discover and understand its causes and its workings, we overcome it by the very knowing; the unconscious dissolves when brought into the conscious. The dissolution of the unconscious releases energy; the mind feels adequate and become quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the use of a quiet mind?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> When the mind is quiet, we come to know ourselves as the pure witness. We withdraw from the experience and its experiencer and stand apart in pure awareness, which is between and beyond the two. The personality, based on self-identification, on imagining oneself to be something: ‘I am this, I am that&#39;, continues, but only as a part of the objective world. Its identification with the witness snaps.</p>
<p><strong>Witnessing</strong></p>
<p>Discover all you are not. Body, feelings, thoughts, ideas, time, space, being and not-being, this or that -- nothing concrete or abstract you can point out to is you. A mere verbal statement will not do -- you may repeat a formula endlessly without any result whatsoever. You must watch yourself continuously -- particularly your mind -- moment by moment, missing nothing. This witnessing is essential for the separation of the self from the not-self.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The witnessing -- is it not my real nature?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> For witnessing, there must be something else to witness. We are still in duality!</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What about witnessing the witness? Awareness of awareness?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Putting words together will not take you far. Go within and discover what you are not. Nothing else matters.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness and Consciousness</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> You use the words ‘aware&#39; and ‘conscious&#39;. Are they not the same?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Awareness is primordial; it is the original state, beginningless, endless, uncaused, unsupported, without parts, without change. Consciousness is on contact, a reflection against a surface, a state of duality. There can be no consciousness without awareness, but there can be awareness without consciousness, as in deep sleep. Awareness is absolute, consciousness is relative to its content; consciousness is always of something. Consciousness is partial and changeful, awareness is total, changeless, calm and silent. And it is the common matrix of every experience.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How does one go beyond consciousness into awareness?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Since it is awareness that makes consciousness possible, there is awareness in every state of consciousness. Therefore, the very consciousness of being conscious is already a movement in awareness. Interest in your stream of consciousness takes you to awareness. It is not a new state. It is at once recognized as the original, basic existence, which is life itself, and also love and joy.</p>
<p><strong>The Person is not Reality</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Within the field of your consciousness there is your body also.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Of course. But the idea ‘my body&#39;, as different from other bodies, is not there. To me it is ‘a body&#39;, not ‘my body&#39;, ‘a mind&#39;, not ‘my mind&#39;. The mind looks after the body all right, I need not interfere. What needs be done is being done, in the normal and natural way. You may not be quite conscious of your physiological functions, but when it comes to thoughts and feelings, desires and fears, you become acutely self-conscious. To me these too are largely unconscious. I find myself talking to people, or doing things quite correctly and appropriately, without being very much conscious of them. It looks as if I live my physical, waking life automatically, reacting spontaneously and accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does this spontaneous response come as a result of realization, or by training?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Both. Devotion to your goal makes you live a clean and orderly life, given to search for truth and to helping people, and realization makes noble virtue easy and spontaneous, by removing for good the obstacles in the shape of desires and fears and wrong ideas.</p>
<p><strong>To Know What you Are, Find What you Are Not</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am what I know myself to be.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> You cannot possibly say that you are what you think yourself to be! Your ideas about yourself change from day to day and from moment to moment. Your self-image is the most changeful thing you have. It is utterly vulnerable, at the mercy of a passer by. A bereavement, the loss of a job, an insult, and your image of yourself, which you call your person, changes deeply. To know what you are you must first investigate and know what you are not. And to know what you are not you must watch yourself carefully, rejecting all that does not necessarily go with the basic fact: ‘I am&#39;. The ideas: I am born at a given place, at a given time, from my parents and now I am so-and-so, living at, married to, father of, employed by, and so on, are not inherent in the sense ‘I am&#39;. Our usual attitude is of ‘I am this&#39;. Separate consistently and perseveringly the ‘I am&#39; from ‘this&#39; or ‘that&#39;, and try to feel what it means to be, just to be, without being ‘this&#39; or ‘that&#39;. All our habits go against it and the task of fighting them is long and hard sometimes, but clear understanding helps a lot. The clearer you understand that on the level of the mind you can be described in negative terms only, the quicker you will come to the end of your search and realize your limitless being.</p>
<p><strong>The Supreme is Beyond All</strong></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> The person is never the subject. You can see a person, but you are not the person. You are always the Supreme which appears at a given point of time and space as the witness, a bridge between the pure awareness of the Supreme and the manifold consciousness of the person.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When I look at myself, I find I am several persons fighting among themselves for the use of the body.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> They correspond to the various tendencies (samskara) of the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I make peace between them?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> How can you? They are so contradictory! See them as they are -- mere habits of thoughts and feelings, bundles of memories and urges.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Yet they all say ‘I am&#39;.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> It is only because you identify yourself with them. Once you realize that whatever appears before you cannot be yourself, and cannot say ‘I am&#39;, you are free of all your ‘persons&#39; and their demands. The sense ‘I am&#39; is your own. You cannot part with it, but you can impart it to anything, as in saying: I am young. I am rich etc. But such self-identifications are patently false and the cause of bondage.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> My question is: How to find the way to one&#39;s own being?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Give up all questions except one: ‘Who am I&#39;? After all, the only fact you are sure of is that you are. The ‘I am&#39; is certain. The ‘I am this&#39; is not. Struggle to find out what you are in reality.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am doing nothing else for the last years.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> What is wrong with striving? Why look for results? Striving itself is your real nature.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Striving is painful.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> You make it so by seeking results. Strive without seeking, struggle without greed.</p>
<p><strong>Discrimination leads to Detachment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> To be a superman one must be a man first. Manhood is the fruit of innumerable experiences. Desire drives to experience. Hence at its own time and level desire is right.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> All this is true in a way. But a day comes when you have amassed enough and must begin to build. Then sorting out and discarding (viveka-vairagya) are absolutely necessary. Everything must be scrutinized and the unnecessary ruthlessly destroyed. Believe me, there cannot be too much destruction. For in reality nothing is of value. Be passionately dispassionate -- that is all.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Being nothing, I am all. Everything is me, everything is mine. Just as my body moves by my mere thinking of the movement, so do things happen as think of them. Mind you, I do nothing. I just see them happen.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do things happen as you want them to happen, or do you want them to happen as they happen?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Both. I accept and am accepted. I am all and all is me. Being the world I am not afraid of the world. Being all, what am I to be afraid of? Water is not afraid of water, nor fire of fire. Also I am not afraid because I am nothing that can experience fear, or can be in danger. I have no shape, nor name. It is attachment to a name and shape that breeds fear. I am not attached. I am nothing, and nothing is afraid of no thing.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It is all well on its own level. But how does it work in daily life?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> The daily life is a life of action. Whether you like it or not, you must function. Whatever you do for your own sake accumulates and becomes explosive; one day it goes off and plays havoc with you and your world. When you deceive yourself that you work for the good of all, it makes matters worse, for you should not be guided by your own ideas of what is good for others. A man who claims to know what is good for others, is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How is one to work then?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Neither for yourself nor for others, but for the work&#39;s own sake. A thing worth doing is its own purpose and meaning. Make nothing a means to something else. Bind not. God does not create one thing to serve another. Each is made for its own sake.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Surely, you care when your child is ill, don&#39;t you?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> I don&#39;t get flustered. I just do the needful. I do not worry about the future. A right response to every situation is in my nature. I do not stop to think what to do. I act and move on. Results do not affect me. I do not even care, whether they are good or bad. Whatever they are, they are -- if they come back to me, I deal with them afresh. Or, rather, I happen to deal with them afresh. There is no sense of purpose in my doing anything. Things happens as they happen -- not because I make them happen, but it is because I am that they happen.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Your personal universe does not exist by itself. It is merely a limited and distorted view of the real. It is not the universe that needs improving, but your way of looking.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you view it?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> It is a stage on which a world drama is being played. The quality of the performance is all that matters; not what the actors say and do, but how they say and do it.</p>
<p><strong>Personality, an Obstacle</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is not personality required for gathering experience?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> As you are now, the personality is only an obstacle. Self-identification with the body may be good for an infant, but true growing up depends on getting the body out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you keep on dismissing the person (vyakti) as of no importance? Personality is the primary fact of our existence. It occupies the entire stage.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> As long as you do not see that it is mere habit, built on memory, prompted by desire, you will think yourself to be a person -- living, feeling, thinking, active, passive, pleased or pained. Question yourself, ask yourself. ‘Is it so?&#39; ‘Who am I&#39;? ‘What is behind and beyond all this?&#39; And soon you will see your mistake. And it is in the very nature of a mistake to cease to be, when seen.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If just living one&#39;s life liberates, why are not all liberated?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> All are being liberated. It is not what you live, but how you live that matters. The idea of enlightenment is of utmost importance. Just to know that there is such possibility, changes one&#39;s entire outlook. It acts like a burning match in a heap of saw dust.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If I start the practice of dismissing everything as a dream, where will it lead me?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Wherever it leads you, it will be a dream. The very idea of going beyond the dream is illusory. Why go anywhere? Just realize that you are dreaming a dream you call the world, and stop looking for ways out. The dream is not your problem. Your problem is that you like one part of your dream and not another. Love all, or none of it, and stop complaining. When you have seen the dream as a dream, you have done all that needs be done.</p>
<p><strong>Do not Undervalue Attention</strong></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Do not undervalue attention. It means interest and also love. To know, to do, to discover, or to create you must give your heart to it -- which means attention. All the blessings flow from it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> You advise us to concentrate on ‘I am&#39;. Is this too a form of attention?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> What else? Give your undivided attention to the most important in your life -- yourself. Of your personal universe you are the centre -- without knowing the centre what else can you know?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> But how can I know myself? To know myself I must be away from myself. But what is away from myself cannot be myself. So, it looks that I cannot know myself, only what I take to be myself.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Quite right. As you cannot see your face, but only its reflection in the mirror, so you can know only your image reflected in the stainless mirror of pure awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How am I to get such stainless mirror?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Obviously, by removing stains. See the stains and remove them. The ancient teaching is fully valid.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is seeing and what is removing?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> The nature of the perfect mirror is such that you cannot see it. Whatever you can see is bound to be a stain. Turn away from it, give it up, know it as unwanted.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> All perceivables, are they stains?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> All are stains.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The entire world is a stain.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>Life is the Supreme Guru</strong></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> You can spend an eternity looking elsewhere for truth and love, intelligence and goodwill, imploring God and man -- all in vain. You must begin in yourself, with yourself -- this is the inexorable law. You cannot change the image without changing the face. First realize that your world is only a reflection of yourself and stop finding fault with the reflection. Attend to yourself, set yourself right -- mentally and emotionally. The physical will follow automatically. You talk so much of reforms: economic, social, political. Leave alone the reforms and mind the reformer. What kind of world can a man create who is stupid, greedy, heartless?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If we have to wait for a change of heart, we shall have to wait indefinitely. Yours is a counsel of perfection, which is also a counsel of despair. When all are perfect, the world will be perfect. What useless truism!</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> I did not say it. I only said: You cannot change the world before changing yourself. I did not say -- before changing everybody. It is neither necessary, nor possible to change others. But if you can change yourself you will find that no other change is needed. To change the picture you merely change the film, you do not attack the cinema screen!</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How can you be so sure of yourself? How do you know that what you say is true?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> It is not of myself that I am sure, I am sure of you. All you need is to stop searching outside what can be found only within. Set your vision right before you operate. You are suffering from acute misapprehension. Clarify your mind, purify your heart, sanctify your life -- this is the quickest way to a change of your world.</p>
<p><strong>Everything Happens by Itself</strong></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> It is ignorance of yourself that makes you afraid and also unaware that you are afraid. Don&#39;t try not to be afraid. Break down the wall of ignorance first. People are afraid to die, because they do not know what is death. The gnani has died before his death, he saw that there was nothing to be afraid of. The moment you know your real being, you are afraid of nothing. Death gives freedom and power. To be free in the world, you must die to the world. Then the universe is your own, it becomes your body, an expression and a tool. The happiness of being absolutely free is beyond description. On the other hand, he who is afraid of freedom cannot die.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> You mean that one who cannot die, cannot live?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Put it as you like; attachment is bondage, detachment is freedom. To crave is to slave.</p>
<p>Have your being outside this body of birth and death and all your problems will be solved. They exist because you believe yourself born to die. Undeceive yourself and be free. You are not a person.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Practice is Will Asserted and Re-asserted</strong></p>
<p>I am showing you a short and easy way to being able to see what I see, but you cling to your old habits of thought, feeling and action and put all the blame on me. I have nothing which you do not have. Self-knowledge is not a piece of property to be offered and accepted. It is a new dimension altogether, where there is nothing to give or take.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Give us at least some insight into the content of your mind while you live your daily life. To eat, to drink, to talk, to sleep -- how does it feel at your end?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> The common things of life: I experience them just as you do. The difference lies in what I do not experience. I do not experience fear or greed, hate or anger. I ask nothing, refuse nothing, keep nothing. In these matters I do not compromise. Maybe this is the outstanding difference between us. I will not compromise, I am true to myself, while you are afraid of reality.</p>
<p><strong>By Itself Nothing has Existence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> As I listen to you I find that it is useless to ask you questions. Whatever the question, you invariably turn it upon itself and bring me to the basic fact that I am living in an illusion of my own making and that reality is inexpressible in words. Words merely add to the confusion and the only wise course is the silent search within.</p>
<p><strong>Maharaj:</strong> After all, it is the mind that creates illusion and it is the mind that gets free of it. Words may aggravate illusion, words may also help dispel it. There is nothing wrong in repeating the same truth again and again until it becomes reality.</p>
<p><strong>Only the Self is Real</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maharaj:</strong> The world is but a show, glittering and empty. It is, and yet is not. It is there as long as I want to see it and take part in it. When I cease caring, it dissolves. It has no cause and serves no purpose. It just happens when we are absentminded. It appears exactly as it looks, but there is no depth in it, nor meaning. Only the onlooker is real, call him Self or Atma. To the Self the world is but a colourful show, which he enjoys as long as it lasts and forgets when it is over. Whatever happens on the stage makes him shudder in terror or roll with laughter, yet all the time he is aware that it is but a show. Without desire or fear he enjoys it, as it happens.</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> The person immersed in the world has a life of many flavours. He weeps, he laughs, loves and hates, desires and fears, suffers and rejoices. The desireless and fearless gnani, what life has he? Is he not left high and dry in his aloofness?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> His state is not so desolate. It tastes of the pure, uncaused, undiluted bliss. He is happy and fully aware that happiness is his very nature and that he need not do anything, nor strive for anything to secure it. It follows him, more real than the body, nearer than the mind itself. You imagine that without cause there can be no happiness. To me dependence on anything for happiness is utter misery. Pleasure and pain have causes, while my state is my own, totally uncaused, independent, unassailable.</p>
<p>Obsessed with the idea of means and end, of work and purpose, you see me apparently functioning. In realty I only look. Whatever is done, is done on the stage. Joy and sorrow, life and death, they all are real to the man in bondage; to me they are all in the show, as unreal as the show itself. I may perceive the world just like you, but you believe to be in it, while I see it as an iridescent drop in the vast expanse of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Let us say, the gnani is ill. He has caught some flu and every joint aches and burns. What is his state of mind?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Every sensation is contemplated in perfect equanimity. There is no desire for it, nor refusal. It is as it is and the he looks at it with a smile of affectionate detachment.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> He may be detached from his own suffering, but still it is there.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> It is there, but it does not matter. Whatever state I am in, I see it as a state of mind to be accepted as it is.</p>
<p><strong>Develop the Witness Attitude</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> What is the daily and hourly state of mind of a realized man? How does he see, hear, eat, drink, wake and sleep, work and rest? What proof is there of his state as different from ours? Apart from the verbal testimony of the so-called realized people, is there no way of verifying their state objectively. Are there not some observable differences in their physiological and nervous responses, in their metabolism, or brain waves, or in their psychosomatic structure?</p>
<p><strong>Maharaj:</strong> You may find differences, or you may not. All depends on your capacity of observation. The objective differences are however, the least important. What matters is their outlook, their attitude, which is that of total detachment, aloofness, standing apart.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does not a gnani feel sorrow when his child dies, does he not suffer?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> He suffers with those who suffer. The event itself is of little importance, but he is full of compassion for the suffering being, whether alive or dead, in the body or out of it. After all, love and compassion are his very nature. He is one with all that lives and love is that oneness in action.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> People are very much afraid of death.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> The gnani is afraid of nothing. But he pities the man who is afraid. After all, to be born, to live and to die is natural. To be afraid is not. To the event, of course, attention is given.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If nature is in the mind and the mind is my own, I should be able to control nature, which is not really the case. Forces beyond my control determine my behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Develop the witness attitude and you will find in your own experience that detachment brings control. The state of witnessing is full of power, there is nothing passive about it.</p>
<p><strong>Reality can not be Expressed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> I have noticed a new self emerging in me, independent of the old self. They somehow co-exist. The old self goes on its habitual ways; the new lets the old be, but does not identify itself with it. Maharaj: What is the main difference between the old self and the new?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The old self wants everything defined and explained. It wants things to fit each other verbally. The new does not care for verbal explanations -- it accepts things as they are and does not seek to relate them to things remembered.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Are you fully and constantly aware of the difference between the habitual and the spiritual? What is the attitude of the new self to the old?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The new just looks at the old. It is neither friendly nor inimical. It just accepts the old self along with everything else. It does not deny its being, but does not accept its value and validity.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> When you talk of the old self and new, whom do you have in mind? As there is continuity in memory between the two, each remembering the other, how can you speak of two selves?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> One is a slave to habits, the other is not. One conceptualizes, the other is free from all ideas.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Why two selves? Between the bound and the free there can be no relationship. The very fact of co-existence proves their basic unity. There is but one self -- it is always now. What you call the other self -- old or new -- is but a modality, another aspect of the one self. The self is single. You are that self and you have ideas of what you have been or will be. But an idea is not the self.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Watch your mind, how it comes into being, how it operates. As you watch your mind, you discover your self as the watcher. When you stand motionless, only watching, you discover your self as the light behind the watcher. The source of light is dark, unknown is the source of knowledge. That source alone is. Go back to that source and abide there.</p>
<p><strong><em>I am</em> is True, all else is Inference</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Surely there is something valid and valuable in every approach.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> In each case the value lies in bringing you to the need of seeking within. Playing with various approaches may be due to resistance to going within, to the fear of having to abandon the illusion of being something or somebody in particular. To find water you do not dig small pits all over the place, but drill deep in one place only. Similarly, to find your self you have to explore yourself. When you realize that you are the light of the world, you will also realize that you are the love of it; that to know is to love and to love is to know.</p>
<p><strong>What Comes and Goes has no Being</strong></p>
<p>All your problems arise because you have defined and therefore limited yourself. When you do not think yourself to be this or that, all conflict ceases. Any attempt to do something about your problems is bound to fail, for what is caused by desire can be undone only in freedom from desire. You have enclosed yourself in time and space, squeezed yourself into the span of a lifetime and the volume of a body and thus created the innumerable conflicts of life and death, pleasure and pain, hope and fear. You cannot be rid of problems without abandoning illusions.</p>
<p>See that you are not what you believe yourself to be. Fight with all the strength at your disposal against the idea that you are nameable and describable. You are not. Refuse to think of yourself in terms of this or that.</p>
<p>That which you are, your true self, you love it, and whatever you do, you do for your own happiness. To find it, to know it, to cherish it is your basic urge. Since time immemorial you loved yourself, but never wisely. Use your body and mind wisely in the service of the self, that is all. Be true to your own self, love your self absolutely. Do not pretend that you love others as yourself. Unless you have realized them as one with yourself, you cannot love them. Don&#39;t pretend to be what you are not, don&#39;t refuse to be what you are. Your love of others is the result of self-knowledge, not its cause. Without self-realization, no virtue is genuine. Where you know beyond all doubting that the same life flows through all that is and you are that life, you will love all naturally and spontaneously. When you realize the depth and fullness of your love of yourself, you know that every living being and the entire universe are included in your affection. But when you look at anything as separate from you, you cannot love it for you are afraid of it. Alienation causes fear and fear deepens alienation. It is a vicious circle. Only self-realization can break it. Go for it resolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Watch your Mind</strong></p>
<p>Realize that whatever you think yourself to be is just a stream of events; that while all happens, comes and goes, you alone are, the changeless among the changeful, the self-evident among the inferred. Separate the observed from the observer and abandon false identifications.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Whatever you may have to do, watch your mind. Also you must have moments of complete inner peace and quiet, when your mind is absolutely still. If you miss it, you miss the entire thing. If you do not, the silence of the mind will dissolve and absorb all else.</p>
<p>Be like an infant with nothing standing between the body and the self. The constant noise of the psychic life is absent. In deep silence the self contemplates the body. It is like the white paper on which nothing is written yet. Be like that infant, instead of trying to be this or that, be happy to be. You will be a fully awakened witness of the field of consciousness. But there should be no feelings and ideas to stand between you and the field.</p>
<p>Be interested in yourself beyond all experiences, be with yourself, love yourself; the ultimate security is found only in self-knowledge. The main thing is earnestness. Be honest with yourself and nothing will betray you. Virtues and powers are mere tokens for children to play with. They are useful in the world, but do not take you out of it. To go beyond, you need alert immobility, quiet attention.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness is Free</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> As I can make out, you give distinct meanings to the words ‘mind&#39;, ‘consciousness&#39;, and ‘awareness&#39;.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Look at it this way. The mind produces thoughts ceaselessly, even when you do not look at them. When you know what is going on in your mind, you call it consciousness. This is your waking state -- your consciousness shifts from sensation to sensation, from perception to perception, from idea to idea, in endless succession. Then comes awareness, the direct insight into the whole of consciousness, the totality of the mind. The mind is like a river, flowing ceaselessly in the bed of the body; you identify yourself for a moment with some particular ripple and call it: ‘my thought&#39;. All you are conscious of is your mind; awareness is the cognizance of consciousness as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Everybody is conscious, but not everybody is aware.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Don&#39;t say: ‘everybody is conscious&#39;. Say: ‘there is consciousness&#39;, in which everything appears and disappears. Our minds are just waves on the ocean of consciousness. As waves they come and go. As ocean they are infinite and eternal. Know yourself as the ocean of being, the womb of all existence. These are all metaphors of course; the reality is beyond description. You can know it only by being it.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Mind, there is no Suffering</strong></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> I find that somehow, by shifting the focus of attention, I become the very thing I look at and experience the kind of consciousness it has; I become the inner witness of the thing. I call this capacity of entering other focal points of consciousness -- love; you may give it any name you like. Love says: ‘I am everything&#39;. Wisdom says: ‘I am nothing&#39; Between the two my life flows. Since at any point of time and space I can be both the subject and the object of experience, I express it by saying that I am both, and neither, and beyond both.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The universe does not seem a happy place to live in. Why is there so much suffering?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Pain is physical; suffering is mental. Beyond the mind there is no suffering. Pain is merely a signal that the body is in danger and requires attention. Similarly, suffering warns us that the structure of memories and habits, which we call the person (vyakti), is threatened by loss or change. Pain is essential for the survival of the body, but none compels you to suffer. Suffering is due entirely to clinging or resisting; it is a sign of our unwillingness to move on, to flow with life. As a sane life is free of pain, so is a saintly life free from suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Experience is not the Real Thing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maharaj:</strong> The seeker is he who is in search of himself. Soon he discovers that his own body he cannot be. Once the conviction: ‘I am not the body&#39; becomes so well grounded that he can no longer feel, think and act for and on behalf of the body, he will easily discover that he is the universal being, knowing, acting, that in him and through him the entire universe is real, conscious and active. This is the heart of the problem. Either you are body-conscious and a slave of circumstances, or you are the universal consciousness itself -- and in full control of every event.</p>
<p>Mere listening, even memorizing, is not enough. If you do not struggle hard to apply every word of it in your daily life, don&#39;t complain that you made no progress. All real progress is irreversible. Ups and downs merely show that the teaching has not been taken to heart and translated into action fully.</p>
<p><strong>I and <em>Mine</em> are False Ideas</strong></p>
<p>When you recognize the ‘I&#39; as it is, a bundle of desires and fears, and the sense of ‘mine&#39;, as embracing all things and people needed for the purpose of avoiding pain and securing pleasure, you will see that the ‘I&#39; and the ‘mine&#39; are false ideas, having no foundation in reality. Created by the mind, they rule their creator as long as it takes them to be true; when questioned, they dissolve.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I find myself suffering, but not enough. Life is unpleasant, but bearable. My little pleasures compensate me for my small pains and on the whole I am better off than most of the people I know. I know that my condition is precarious, that a calamity can overtake me any moment. Must I wait for a crisis to put me on my way to truth?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> The moment you have seen how fragile is your condition, you are already alert. Now, keep alert, give attention, enquire, investigate, discover your mistakes of mind and body and abandon them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where is the energy to come from? I am like a paralyzed man in a burning house.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Even paralyzed people sometimes find their legs in a moment of danger! But you are not paralyzed, you merely imagine so. Make the first step and you will be on your way.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> All and sundry are urging me to meditate. I find no zest in meditation, but I am interested in many others things; some I want very much and my mind goes to them; my attempts at meditation are so half-hearted, what am I to do?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Ask yourself: ‘to whom it all happens?&#39; Use everything as an opportunity to go within. Light your way by burning up obstacles in the intensity of awareness. When you happen to desire or fear, it is not the desire or fear that are wrong and must go, but the person who desires and fears. There is no point in fighting desires and fears which may be perfectly natural and justified; it is the person, who is swayed by them, that is the cause of mistakes, past and future. This person should be carefully examined and its falseness seen; then its power over you will end. After all, it subsides each time you go to sleep. In deep sleep you are not a self-conscious person, yet you are alive. When you are alive and conscious, but no longer self-conscious, you are not a person any more. During the waking hours you are, as if, on the stage, playing a role, but what are you when the play is over? You are what you are; what you were before the play began you remain when it is over. Look at yourself as performing on the stage of life. The performance may be splendid or clumsy, but you are not in it, you merely watch it; with interest and sympathy, of course, but keeping in mind all the time that you are only watching while the play -- life -- is going on.</p>
<p><strong>Pleasure and Happiness</strong></p>
<p>You say you are happy. Are you really happy, or are you merely trying to convince yourself. Look at yourself fearlessly and you will at once realize that your happiness depends on conditions and circumstances, hence it is momentary, not real. Real happiness flows from within.</p>
<p><strong>You are Beyond Space and Time</strong></p>
<p>Just see the person you imagine yourself to be as a part of the world you perceive within your mind and look at the mind from the outside, for you are not the mind. After all, your only problem is the eager self-identification with whatever you perceive. Give up this habit, remember that you are not what you perceive, use your power of alert aloofness. See yourself in all that lives and your behaviour will express your vision. Once you realize that there is nothing in this world, which you can call your own, you look at it from the outside as you look at a play on the stage, or a picture on the screen, admiring and enjoying, but really unmoved. As long as you imagine yourself to be something tangible and solid, a thing among things, actually existing in time and space, shortlived and vulnerable, naturally you will be anxious to survive and increase. But when you know yourself as beyond space and time -- in contact with them only at the point of here and now, otherwise all-pervading and all containing, unapproachable, unassailable, invulnerable -- you will be afraid no longer. Know yourself as you are -- against fear there is no other remedy.</p>
<p>You have to learn to think and feel on these lines, or you will remain indefinitely on the personal level of desire and fear, gaining and losing, growing and decaying. A personal problem cannot be solved on its own level. The very desire to live is the messenger of death, as the longing to be happy is the outline of sorrow. The world is an ocean of pain and fear, of anxiety and despair. Pleasures are like the fishes, few and swift, rarely come, quickly gone. A man of low intelligence believes, against all evidence, that he is an exception and that the world owes him happiness. But the world cannot give what it does not have; unreal to the core, it is of no use for real happiness. It cannot be otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Accept Life as it Comes</strong></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Look at the content of your mind. You are what you think about. Are you not most of the time busy with your own little person and its daily needs? The value of regular meditation is that it takes you away from the humdrum of daily routine and reminds you that you are not what you believe yourself to be. But even remembering is not enough -- action must follow conviction. Don&#39;t be like the rich man who has made a detailed will, but refuses to die.</p>
<p><strong>The Perceived can not be the Perceiver</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I find that the various aspects of myself are at war between themselves and there is no peace in me. Where are freedom and courage, wisdom and compassion? My actions merely increase the chasm in which I exist.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> It is all so, because you take yourself to be somebody, or something. Stop, look, investigate, ask the right questions, come to the right conclusions and have the courage to act on them and see what happens. The first steps may bring the roof down on your head, but soon the commotion will clear and there will be peace and joy. You know so many things about yourself, but the knower you do not know. Find out who you are, the knower of the known. Look within diligently, remember to remember that the perceived cannot be the perceiver. Whatever you see, hear or think of, remember -- you are not what happens, you are he to whom it happens. Delve deeply into the sense ‘I am&#39; and you will surely discover that the perceiving centre is universal, as universal as the light that illumines the world. All that happens in the universe happens to you, the silent witness. On the other hand, whatever is done, is done by you, the universal and inexhaustible energy.</p>
<p>This dwelling on the sense ‘I am&#39; is the simple, easy and natural Yoga, the Nisarga Yoga. There is no secrecy in it and no dependence; no preparation is required and no initiation. Whoever is puzzled by his very existence as a conscious being and earnestly wants to find his own source, can grasp the ever-present sense of ‘I am&#39; and dwell on it assiduously and patiently, till the clouds obscuring the mind dissolve and the heart of being is seen in all its glory.</p>
<p>The Nisarga Yoga, when persevered in and brought to its fruition, results in one becoming conscious and active in what one always was unconsciously and passively. There is no difference in kind -- only in manner -- the difference between a lump of gold and a glorious ornament shaped out of it. Life goes on, but it is spontaneous and free, meaningful and happy.</p>

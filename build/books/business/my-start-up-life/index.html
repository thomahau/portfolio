                <p><strong>The Fringe-Thoughts List: Where Most Great Ideas Develop</strong></p>
<p>Random ideas, quotes, people I need to talk to, a funny conversation overheard at the table next to me at a caf√©, a book recommendation, a gift idea, a potential blog post, a short-term task, a long-term project, new business ideas. I try to capture, record, review, refine, and publish as many of these fringe thoughts as I can. Besides making you a better conversationalist, organizing your fringe thoughts is one way toward a more intellectually coherent worldview.</p>
<p>Write stuff down carelessly. Recording fringe thoughts is an exercise in creativity, and research shows that the minute we try to add a filter to our thinking--for coherence, approval, or completeness--is the minute the ideas tap goes cold.</p>
<p><strong>Why Some People Get More Stuff Done (and Start Real Businesses)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>People who get stuff done maintain a high commitment to themselves.</em> They don&#39;t want to let themselves down. The chief motivation to achieve comes from within, not externally. It is easy to not keep promises you make to yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>People who get stuff done strive for &quot;good enough.&quot;</em> Good enough is a key principle in entrepreneurship. If your aim is &quot;perfect,&quot; the future is so far away it may be hard to get going.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>People who get stuff done think about the short-term future.</em> It&#39;s easy to analyze the present or dream about the distant future, but actionable tasks over the next two to four weeks are most important for keeping the ball moving.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>People who get stuff done &quot;dream&quot; and &quot;talk&quot; as much as the next guy, but they share these dreams and ideas with others.</em> By sharing your intentions with others, you introduce yet another accountability mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>People who get stuff done begin.</em> Taking that first step can be the hardest. Act now! &quot;A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If something is difficult, I break it down into parts and organize its related tasks on my computer. When I&#39;m effective and productive, I treat myself by going to the gym, eating an energy bar, or making time to do a blog post. Do you want to be known as a doer or a talker?</p>
<p><strong>Building Resilience--A Transferable Quotient</strong></p>
<p>We all go through rough times. The most successful people don&#39;t just survive, they thrive. I believe resilience is a skill that can be acquired. It&#39;s all about the little things. You build resilience by finishing small goals you set even if you feel like quitting. Fighting through pain on the treadmill contributes a bit to the resilience quotient (RQ).</p>
<p>RQ can be applied throughout life--being resilient in one setting will help me be resilient in unrelated others. I want to get the job done and endure an uncomfortable day because I know that grappling with all that life throws at me on a day-to-day basis will help me be resilient in the face of a traumatic and extraordinary situation. If I can get up today, I can get up any day. During the perfect storm, you must have a high resilience quotient. Prepare for it.</p>
<p><strong>Three Sure Ways to Maximize Luck</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Expose yourself to as much randomness as possible.</em> Attend conferences no one else is attending. Read books no one else is reading. Talk to people no one else is talking to.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Trust in probabilities of luck.</em> I think life works in peaks and valleys. Every time luck doesn&#39;t go my way I believe a piece of good luck is right around the corner--you always bounce up after hitting rock bottom. Similarly, whenever I get lucky I prepare myself for weathering a dip. Knowing this, I can always mitigate a rough stretch and make the most of the good times.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Trick yourself.</em> Self-deception is essential for high self-esteem. It&#39;s OK to take more credit than you deserve, in your own mind, for successes. It&#39;s OK to think that you can outwork and outpassion anyone who competes with you. It&#39;s OK to attribute soaring victories to a tireless work ethic. It&#39;s OK if these are slight exaggerations. After all, how many people attribute &quot;good luck&quot; to their wins? Far fewer than those who attribute &quot;bad luck&quot; to their losses! Stay humble, especially on the outside, but consider yourself (privately) as unstoppable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Random Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Meet as many people as you can.</em> Be open to randomness when meeting new people. Apply a &quot;Who knows?&quot; mentality to every encounter. After you meet someone, be meticulous in your organization and follow-up.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Write down everything.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Become a sophisticated listener.</em> Try to discern hidden meanings.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Create an expert effect.</em> Develop expertise in an issue that others will find valuable. Become an indispenable resource in something.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Travel somewhere.</em> Get outside your normal frame of reference and see what happens. See if you approach an issue with a new perspective. See if a new physical place puts you in a new mental place.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Raise the bar for one day and observe results.</em> Hold impeccable standards for one full day. Easier than you thought?</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Write a blog.</em> Put yourself out there. Share your ideas. Disclose yourself. Become transparent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Put your heart into it.</em> Say what you mean and mean what you say. Total enthusiasm--straight from the heart--in all efforts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Find someone younger/less experienced than you and help them.</em> Give a little, get a lot back.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Find your pole.</em> Life gets crazy sometimes. We all need to swing around something. Find your pole, your steadying center influence, and never lose sight of it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Have multiple side projects going.</em> Diversify your portfolio of interests and activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Be funny.</em> Humor can be scarce in a serious world. Be that guy people want to be around. Research humor and good one-liners.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Make people feel like a million bucks.</em> It all starts with people.</p>
</li>
</ul>

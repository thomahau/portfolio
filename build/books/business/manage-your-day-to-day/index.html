                <p><strong>BUILDING A ROCK-SOLID ROUTINE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>GREAT WORK BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE</strong>
Do your most meaningful creative work at the beginning of your day, and leave &quot;reactive work&quot;--like responding to e-mail or other messages--for later.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>JUMP-START YOUR CREATIVITY</strong>
Establish &quot;associative triggers&quot;--such as listening to the same music or arranging your desk in a certain way--that tell your mind it&#39;s time to get down to work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>FEEL THE FREQUENCY</strong>
Commit to working on your project at consistent intervals--ideally every day--to build creative muscle and momentum over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PULSE AND PAUSE</strong>
Move rhythmically between spending and renewing your energy by working in ninety-minute bursts and then taking a break.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>GET LONELY</strong>
Make a point of spending some time alone each day. It&#39;s a way to observe unproductive habits and thought processes, and to calm your mind.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DON&#39;T WAIT FOR MOODS</strong>
Show up, whether you feel inspired or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FINDING FOCUS IN A DISTRACTED WORLD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>DEFEND YOUR CREATIVE TIME</strong>
Book time on your calendar for uninterrupted, focused work--and respect those blocks of time as you would any client meeting.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>FOCUS WHEN YOU&#39;RE FRESH</strong>
Tackle the projects that require &quot;hard focus&quot; early in your day. Self-control--and our ability to resist distractions--declines as the day goes on.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>KILL THE BACKGROUND NOISE</strong>
Turn off your phone, e-mail, and any apps unrelated to your task. Even the presence of background activity (and temptation) can drain your focus.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>MAKE PROGRESS VISIBLE</strong>
Marking progress is a huge motivator for long-term projects. Make your daily achievements visible by saving iterations, posting milestones, or keeping a daily journal.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>GIVE YOUR BRAIN A BREAK</strong>
Alternate challenging creative work with more &quot;mindless&quot; tasks to give your brain time to rest and refuel.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>TAP INTO TRANSITIONAL MOMENTS</strong>
Take a break from checking your smartphone during transitional moments, and open yourself up to opportunity and serendipity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TAMING YOUR TOOLS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>KEEP THE LONG VIEW IN VIEW</strong>
Post your complex, long-term goals by your workstation to keep them top of mind when prioritizing your tasks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BE CONSCIOUS OF YOUR BANDWIDTH</strong>
Practice letting go of certain e-mail and social media conversations. There will always be more opportunities than you actually can take on.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CHECK YOURSELF, OR WRECK YOURSELF</strong>
Distinguish between compulsive and conscious behaviors. Are you acting out of boredom or blind habit when you could be serving a higher goal?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>HIT THE RESET BUTTON</strong>
Make a ritual of unplugging on a regular basis. Turning everything off is like hitting the &quot;reset&quot; button on your mind--it gives you a fresh start.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DON&#39;T HOLD YOUR BREATH</strong>
Be conscious of your body. Breathing deeply and regularly can decrease your stress levels and help you make better decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>IN IMAGINATION WE TRUST</strong>
Don&#39;t trust technology over your own instincts and imagination. Doing busywork is easy; doing your best work is hard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SHARPENING YOUR CREATIVE MIND</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>PRACTICE UNNECESSARY CREATION</strong>
Use personal creative projects to explore new obsessions, skills, or ways of working in a low-pressure environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>WANDER LONELY AS A CLOUD</strong>
Make time for your mind--and body--to wander when you&#39;re stuck. Disengaging from the problem allows your subconscious to do its work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DEFINE &quot;FINISHED&quot; FROM THE START</strong>
Keep your inner perfectionist in check by defining what finished looks like at the beginning of a project. And when you get there, stop!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DON&#39;T GO ON AUTOPILOT</strong>
Repetition is the enemy of insight. Take unorthodox--even wacky--approaches to solving your stickiest problems and see what happens.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SEARCH FOR THE SOURCE</strong>
When the well runs dry, don&#39;t blame a lack of talent. Creative blocks frequently piggyback on other problems. See if you can identify them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>LOVE YOUR LIMITATIONS</strong>
Look at constraints as a benefit, rather than an impediment. They activate our creative thinking by upping the ante.</p>
</li>
</ul>

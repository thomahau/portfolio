                <p><strong>Public accountability:</strong> Public information has more impact than private information. People care more about what other people know about them than about what they know about themselves. A failure, a slipup, a lapse in self-control can be swept under the carpet pretty easily if you&#39;re the only one who knows about it. You can rationalize it or just plain ignore it. But if other people know about it, it&#39;s harder to dismiss.</p>
<p>When people in laboratory experiments exercise mental self-control, their pulse becomes more erratic; conversely, people whose normal pulse is relatively variable seem to have more inner energy available for self-control, because they do better on laboratory tests of perseverance than do people with steadier heartbeats.</p>
<p>Monthly plans &gt; Daily plans</p>
<p>Closing a door on an option is experienced as a loss, and people are willing to pay a price to avoid the emotion of loss.</p>
<p><strong>The Zeigarnik effect:</strong> Uncompleted tasks and unmet goals tend to pop into one&#39;s mind. Once the task is completed and the goal reached, however, this stream of reminders comes to a stop. The unconscious is asking the conscious mind to make a plan. The unconscious mind apparently can&#39;t do this on its own, so it nags the conscious mind to make a plan with specifics like time, place, and opportunity. Once the plan is formed, the unconscious can stop nagging the conscious mind with reminders.</p>
<p>Once you make that plan--once you put the meeting memo in the tickler file for Wednesday, once you specify the very next action to be taken on the project--you can relax. You don&#39;t have to finish the job right away.</p>
<p>The more competing demands you face, the more time you spend contemplating these demands. You&#39;re beset by rumination.</p>
<p>People who think more about their goals replace action with rumination.</p>
<p>People with clear, unconflicting goals tended to forge ahead and make progress, but the rest were so busy worrying that they got stuck.</p>
<p>People with conflicting goals reported fewer positive emotions, more negative emotions, and more depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>The best results came from the group working on posture. That tiresome old advice--&quot;Sit up straight!&quot;--was more useful than anyone had imagined. By overriding their habit of slouching, the students strengthened their willpower and did better at tasks that had nothing to do with posture.</p>
<p>Make highly specific plans for automatic behavior in certain situations. If x happens, I will do y. The more you use this technique to transfer the control of your behavior to automatic processes, the less effort you will expend.</p>
<p>The more carefully and frequently you monitor yourself, the better you&#39;ll control yourself.</p>
<p>Telling yourself I can have this later operates in the mind a bit like having it now. It satisfies the craving.</p>
<p><strong>The Nothing Alternative</strong> is a marvelously simple tool against procrastination. Two very simple rules, a. you don&#39;t have to work. b. you can&#39;t do anything else. The rest comes of itself. That&#39;s the seeming effortlessness that comes from playing offense.</p>

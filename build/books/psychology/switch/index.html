                </div>
                <p><strong>SWITCH FRAMEWORK</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has an emotional Elephant side and a rational Rider side. You&#39;ve got to reach both. And you&#39;ve also got to clear the way for them to succeed. In short, you must do three things:</p>
<p><strong>DIRECT the Rider (What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. So provide crystal-clear direction.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>FOLLOW THE BRIGHT SPOTS. Investigate what&#39;s working and clone it. [Jerry Sternin in Vietnam, solutions-focused therapy]</p>
</li>
<li><p>SCRIPT THE CRITICAL MOVES. Don&#39;t think big picture, think in terms of specific behaviors. Ambiguity is the enemy. Clarity dissolves resistance. [1% milk, four rules at the Brazilian railroad]</p>
</li>
<li><p>POINT TO THE DESTINATION. Change is easier when you know where you&#39;re going and why it&#39;s worth it. [&quot;You&#39;ll be third graders soon,&quot; &quot;No dry holes&quot; at BP]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MOTIVATE the Elephant (What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. The Rider can&#39;t get his way by force for very long. So it&#39;s critical that you engage people&#39;s emotional side--get their Elephants on the path and cooperative.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>FIND THE FEELING. Knowing something isn&#39;t enough to cause change. Make people feel something. [Piling gloves on the table, the chemotherapy video game, Robyn Waters&#39;s demos at Target]</p>
</li>
<li><p>SHRINK THE CHANGE. Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant. Starting an unpleasant task is always worse than continuing it. Implement micro-milestones. [The 5-Minute Room Rescue, procurement reform]</p>
</li>
<li><p>GROW YOUR PEOPLE. Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset: We will struggle, we will fail, we will be knocked down--but throughout, we&#39;ll get better, and we&#39;ll succeed in the end. [Brasilata&#39;s &quot;inventors,&quot; junior-high math kids&#39; turnaround]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SHAPE the Path (What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. We call the situation (including the surrounding environment) the &quot;Path.&quot; When you shape the Path, you make change more likely, no matter what&#39;s happening with the Rider and Elephant.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>TWEAK THE ENVIRONMENT. When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation. [Throwing out the phone system at Rackspace, 1-Click ordering, simplifying the online time sheet, &quot;sterile cockpit&quot;]</p>
</li>
<li><p>BUILD HABITS. When behavior is habitual, it&#39;s &quot;free&quot;--it doesn&#39;t tax the Rider. Look for ways to encourage habits. [Setting &quot;action triggers,&quot; eating two bowls of soup while dieting, using checklists]</p>
</li>
<li><p>RALLY THE HERD. Behavior is contagious. Help it spread. [&quot;Fataki&quot; in Tanzania, &quot;free spaces&quot; in hospitals, seeding the tip jar]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>KEEP THE SWITCH GOING</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recognize and celebrate that first step.</strong> Something you&#39;ve done has worked. You&#39;ve directed the Rider, you&#39;ve motivated the Elephant, you&#39;ve shaped the Path--and now you&#39;re moving. When you spot movement, you&#39;ve got to reinforce it. Learning to spot and celebrate approximations requires us to scan the environment constantly, looking for little rays of sunshine, and it isn&#39;t easy. Our Riders, by nature, focus on the negative. Problems are easy to spot; progress, much harder. But the progress is precious.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Change isn&#39;t an event; it&#39;s a process.</strong> <em>The mere exposure effect:</em> the more you&#39;re exposed to something, the more you like it. Cognitive dissonance works in your favor. People don&#39;t like to act in one way and think in another. So once a small step has been taken, and people have begun to act in a new way, it will be increasingly difficult for them to dislike the way they&#39;re acting. Similarly, as people begin to act differently, they&#39;ll start to think of themselves differently, and as their identity evolves, it will reinforce the new way of doing things. These forces aren&#39;t contingent on change efforts being successful in the early going; these aren&#39;t the reinforcing spoils of achieving &quot;small wins.&quot; Rather, they kick in automatically as time goes by. So, although inertia may be a formidable opponent in the early goings of your switch, at some point inertia will shift from resisting change to supporting it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OVERCOMING OBSTACLES</strong></p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> We should be doing something, but we&#39;re getting bogged down in analysis.</p>
<p><strong>ADVICE:</strong> 1. Don&#39;t overanalyze and play to the weaknesses of the Rider. Instead, find a feeling that will get the Elephant moving. 2. Create a destination postcard. That way, the Rider starts analyzing how to get there rather than whether anything should be done. 3. Simplify the problem by scripting the critical moves: What&#39;s your equivalent of the 1% milk campaign?</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> The environment has shifted, and we need to overcome our old patterns of behavior.</p>
<p><strong>ADVICE:</strong> 1. Can you create a new habit so the Rider doesn&#39;t constantly have to wrestle the Elephant? 2. Set an action trigger. Preload your decision by imagining the time and place where you&#39;re going to act differently. 3. Use Natalie Elder&#39;s strategy of creating a routine for the morning that eliminates the old, bad behavior. 4. The old pattern is powerful, so make sure to script the critical moves, because ambiguity is the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> I&#39;ll change tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ADVICE:</strong> 1. Shrink the change so you can start today. 2. If you can&#39;t start today, set an action trigger for tomorrow. 3. Make yourself accountable to someone. Let your colleagues or loved ones know what you&#39;re trying to change, so their peer pressure will help you.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> I know what I should be doing, but I&#39;m not doing it.</p>
<p><strong>ADVICE:</strong> 1. Knowing isn&#39;t enough. You&#39;ve got an Elephant problem. 2. Think of the 5-Minute Room Rescue. Starting small can help you overcome dread. What is the most trivial thing that you can do--right at this moment--that would represent a baby step toward the goal? 3. Look for Path solutions. How can you tweak your environment so that you&#39;re &quot;forced&quot; to change? 4. Behavior is contagious. Get someone else involved with you so that you can reinforce each other.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> People were excited at first, but then we hit some rough patches and lost momentum.</p>
<p><strong>ADVICE:</strong> 1. Focus on building habits. When you create habits, you get the new behavior &quot;for free&quot; (think of the stand-up meetings), and you&#39;re less likely to back-slide. 2. Motivate the Elephant by reminding people how much they&#39;ve already accomplished (like putting two stamps on their car-wash cards). 3. Teach the growth mindset. Every success is going to involve rough patches. Recall the IDEO example, which warned people not to panic when the going got tough.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> It&#39;s just too much.</p>
<p><strong>ADVICE:</strong> 1. Shrink the change until it&#39;s not too much. Don&#39;t give the Elephant an excuse to give up. 2. Start developing the growth mindset. Progress doesn&#39;t always come easily--achieving success requires some failures along the way. Don&#39;t beat yourself up when those failures occur.</p>

<p>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can&#39;t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.</p>

<p>Choose not be harmed--and you won&#39;t feel harmed.
Don&#39;t feel harmed--and you haven&#39;t been.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s unfortunate that this has happened.
No. It&#39;s fortunate that this has happened and I&#39;ve remained unharmed by it--not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To shrug it all off and wipe it clean--every annoyance and distraction--and reach utter stillness.
Child&#39;s play.</p>
<p>So other people hurt me? That&#39;s their problem. Their character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is ordained by nature, what I do by my own.</p>
<p>When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances, revert at once to yourself, and don&#39;t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You&#39;ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep on going back to it.</p>
<p>The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way</p>
<p>Latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what they really are. That&#39;s what we need to do all the time--all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust--to lay them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.</p>
<p>Not to assume it&#39;s impossible because you find it hard. But to recognize that if it&#39;s humanly possible, you can do it too.</p>
<p>If anyone can refute me--show me I&#39;m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective--I&#39;ll gladly change. It&#39;s the truth I&#39;m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.</p>
<p>You take things you don&#39;t control and define them as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; And so of course, when the &quot;bad&quot; things happen or the &quot;good&quot; things don&#39;t, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people responsible--or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; to our own actions, we&#39;d have no call to challenge God, or to treat other people as enemies.</p>
<p>Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:</p>
<ul>
<li>To accept this event with humility</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To treat this person as he should be treated</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s silly to try to escape other people&#39;s faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.</p>
<p>Nature willed the creation of the world. Either all that exists follows logically or even those things to which the world&#39;s intelligence most directs its will are completely random.
A source of serenity in more situations than one.</p>
<p>The mind without passions is a fortress. No place is more secure. Once we take refuge there we are safe forever. Not to see this is ignorance. To see it and not seek safety means misery.</p>
<p>Nothing but what you get from first impressions. That someone has insulted you, for instance. That--but not that it&#39;s done you any harm. The fact that my son is sick--that I can see. But &quot;that he might die of it,&quot; no. Stick with first impressions. Don&#39;t extrapolate. And nothing can happen to you.</p>
<p>Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions--not outside.</p>
<p>Learn to ask of all actions, &quot;Why are they doing that?&quot;
Starting with your own.</p>

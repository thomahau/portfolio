                    <h2>Beyond Good and Evil - by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Christianity is Platonism for the &quot;people.&quot;</p>
<p>the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence--perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them.</p>
<p>The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly.</p>
<p>It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence, reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world, as &quot;being-in-itself,&quot; with things, we act once more as we have always acted--MYTHOLOGICALLY.</p>
<p>Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy, where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority--where he may forget &quot;men who are the rule,&quot; as their exception;--exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes; supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as such, he would one day have to say to himself: &quot;The devil take my good taste! but &#39;the rule&#39; is more interesting than the exception--than myself, the exception!&quot; And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go &quot;inside.&quot; The long and serious study of the AVERAGE man--and consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one&#39;s equals):--that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task; I mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the commonplace and &quot;the rule&quot; in themselves, and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES--sometimes they wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out.</p>
<p>In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay.</p>
<p>One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people. &quot;Good&quot; is no longer good when one&#39;s neighbour takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a &quot;common good&quot;! The expression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of small value. In the end things must be as they are and have always been--the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up shortly, everything rare for the rare.</p>
<p>To ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner, almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.</p>
<p>Christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough, to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men, not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man:--SUCH men, with their &quot;equality before God,&quot; have hitherto swayed the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the European of the present day.</p>
<p>He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously--and even himself--only in relation to his pupils.</p>
<p>It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that makes great men.</p>
<p>He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.</p>
<p>A thing that is explained ceases to concern us--What did the God mean who gave the advice, &quot;Know thyself!&quot; Did it perhaps imply &quot;Cease to be concerned about thyself! become objective!&quot;--And Socrates?--And the &quot;scientific man&quot;?</p>
<p>The maturity of man--that means, to have reacquired the seriousness that one had as a child at play.</p>
<p>What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own ideal.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena.</p>
<p>Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman&#39;s play is mediocre.</p>
<p>The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.</p>
<p>The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of another, or of several other, emotions.</p>
<p>The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you allure the senses to it.</p>
<p>One is punished best for one&#39;s virtues.</p>
<p>He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.</p>
<p>Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.</p>
<p>Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover--his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his normal character.</p>
<p>One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when one esteems equal or superior.</p>
<p>One loves ultimately one&#39;s desires, not the thing desired.</p>
<p>&quot;I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can no longer believe in you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dislike him.&quot;--Why?--&quot;I am not a match for him.&quot;--Did any one ever answer so?</p>
<p>As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no &quot;morality of love to one&#39;s neighbour.&quot; Granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness, gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as &quot;virtues,&quot; and eventually almost coincide with the conception &quot;morality&quot;: in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are still ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA. After all, &quot;love to our neighbour&quot; is always a secondary matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utility--under other names, of course, than those here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--when the outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, &quot;the lamb,&quot; and still more &quot;the sheep,&quot; wins respect. There is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it to be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of &quot;punishment&quot; and &quot;the obligation to punish&quot; are then painful and alarming to people. &quot;Is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!&quot;--with these questions gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear, one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer necessary!--Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day European, will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd &quot;we wish that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!&quot; Some time or other--the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called &quot;progress&quot; all over Europe.</p>
<p>Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything &quot;arbitrarily,&quot; and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax--in short, that necessity and &quot;freedom of will&quot; are then the same thing with them.</p>
<p>The fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely &quot;uninteresting&quot; to the average man--if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to act &quot;disinterestedly.&quot;</p>
<p>If, nevertheless, our honesty should one day grow weary, and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and would fain have it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable vice, let us remain HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its help whatever devilry we have in us:--our disgust at the clumsy and undefined, our &quot;NITIMUR IN VETITUM,&quot; our love of adventure, our sharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised, intellectual Will to Power and universal conquest, which rambles and roves avidiously around all the realms of the future--let us go with all our &quot;devils&quot; to the help of our &quot;God&quot;! It is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter!</p>
<p>Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which, losing their way, have come down among them from an elevation: as something delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating--but as something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.</p>
<p>&quot;Exploitation&quot; does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and primitive society; it belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to Life--Granting that as a theory this is a novelty--as a reality it is the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history.</p>
<p>Faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards &quot;selflessness,&quot; belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the &quot;warm heart.&quot;--It is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention.</p>
<p>At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief that to a being such as &quot;we,&quot; other beings must naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things:--if he sought a designation for it he would say: &quot;It is justice itself.&quot; He acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. In general, he looks &quot;aloft&quot; unwillingly--he looks either FORWARD, horizontally and deliberately, or downwards--HE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A HEIGHT.</p>
<p>A man who strives after great things, looks upon every one whom he encounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a delay and hindrance--or as a temporary resting-place.</p>

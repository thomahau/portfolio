                <p>If happiness always depends on something expected in the future, we are chasing a will-o&#39;-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp, until the future, and ourselves, vanish into the abyss of death.</p>
<p>We must here make a clear distinction between belief and faith, because, in general practice, belief has come to mean a state of mind which is almost the opposite of faith. Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would &quot;lief&quot; or wish it to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception.</p>
<p>The power of memories and expectations is such that for most human beings the past and the future are not as real, but more real than the present. The present cannot be lived happily unless the past has been &quot;cleared up&quot; and the future is bright with promise.</p>
<p><strong>The Great Stream</strong></p>
<p>The human body lives because it is a complex of motions, of circulation, respiration, and digestion. To resist change, to try to cling to life, is therefore like holding your breath: if you persist you kill yourself. If you look at it carefully, you will see that consciousness--the thing you call &quot;I&quot;--is really a stream of experiences, of sensations, thoughts, and feelings in constant motion. But because these experiences include memories, we have the impression that &quot;I&quot; is something solid and still, like a tablet upon which life is writing a record. Struggle as we may, &quot;fixing&quot; will never make sense out of change. The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.</p>
<p>Because it is the use and nature of words and thoughts to be fixed, definite, isolated, it is extremely hard to describe the most important characteristic of life--its movement and fluidity.</p>
<p>In practice we are all bewitched by words. We confuse them with the real world, and try to live in the real world as if it were the world of words. As a consequence, we are dismayed and dumbfounded when they do not fit. The more we try to live in the world of words, the more we feel isolated and alone, the more all the joy and liveliness of things is exchanged for mere certainty and security. On the other hand, the more we are forced to admit that we actually live in the real world, the more we feel ignorant, uncertain, and insecure about everything.</p>
<p>If you ask me to show you God, I will point to the sun, or a tree, or a worm. But if you say, &quot;You mean, then, that God is the sun, the tree, the worm, and all other things?&quot;--I shall have to say that you have missed the point entirely.</p>
<p><strong>The Wisdom of the Body</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;primary consciousness,&quot; the basic mind which knows reality rather than ideas about it, does not know the future. It lives completely in the present, and perceives nothing more than what is at this moment. The ingenious brain, however, looks at that part of present experience called memory, and by studying it is able to make predictions. These predictions are, relatively, so accurate and reliable (e.g., &quot;everyone will die&quot;) that the future assumes a high degree of reality--so high that the present loses its value.</p>
<p>The vague, nebulous, and insatiable character of brainy desire makes it particularly hard to come down to earth--to be material and real. Generally speaking, the civilized man does not know what he wants. He works for success, fame, a happy marriage, fun, to help other people, or to be a &quot;real person.&quot; But these are not real wants because they are not actual things. They are the by-products, the flavors and atmospheres of real things--shadows which have no existence apart from some substance. Money is the perfect symbol of all such desires, being a mere symbol of real wealth, and to make it one&#39;s goal is the most blatant example of confusing measurements with reality.</p>
<p>To be used rightly it must be put in its place, for the brain is made for man, not man for his brain. In other words, the function of the brain is to serve the present and the real, not to send man chasing wildly after the phantom of the future. Working rightly, the brain is the highest form of &quot;instinctual wisdom.&quot; Thus it should work like the homing instinct of pigeons and the formation of the foetus in the womb--without verbalizing the process or knowing &quot;how&quot; it does it. The self-conscious brain, like the self-conscious heart, is a disorder, and manifests itself in the acute feeling of separation between &quot;I&quot; and my experience. The brain can only assume its proper behavior when consciousness is doing what it is designed for: not writhing and whirling to get out of present experience, but being effortlessly aware of it.</p>
<p><strong>On Being Aware</strong></p>
<p>It must be obvious, from the start, that there is a contradiction in wanting to be perfectly secure in a universe whose very nature is momentariness and fluidity. But the contradiction lies a little deeper than the mere conflict between the desire for security and the fact of change. If I want to be secure, that is, protected from the flux of life, I am wanting to be separate from life. Yet it is this very sense of separateness which makes me feel insecure. To be secure means to isolate and fortify the &quot;I,&quot; but it is just the feeling of being an isolated &quot;I&quot; which makes me feel lonely and afraid. In other words, the more security I can get, the more I shall want. To put it still more plainly: the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing.</p>
<p>To understand that there is no security is far more than to agree with the theory that all things change, more even than to observe the transitoriness of life. The notion of security is based on the feeling that there is something within us which is permanent, something which endures through all the days and changes of life. We are struggling to make sure of the permanence, continuity, and safety of this enduring core, this center and soul of our being which we call &quot;I.&quot; For this we think to be the real man--the thinker of our thoughts, the feeler of our feelings, and the knower of our knowledge. We do not actually understand that there is no security until we realize that this &quot;I&quot; does not exist.</p>
<p>Understanding comes through awareness. Can we, then, approach our experience--our sensations, feelings, and thoughts--quite simply, as if we had never known them before, and, without prejudice, look at what is going on? You may ask, &quot;Which experiences, which sensations and feelings, shall we look at?&quot; I will answer, &quot;Which ones can you look at?&quot; The answer is that you must look at the ones you have now. That is surely rather obvious. But very obvious things are often overlooked. If a feeling is not present, you are not aware of it. There is no experience but present experience. What you know, what you are actually aware of, is just what is happening at this moment, and no more.</p>
<p>When you see clearly that memory is a form of present experience, it will be obvious that trying to separate yourself from this experience is as impossible as trying to make your teeth bite themselves. There is simply experience. There is not something or someone experiencing experience! You do not feel feelings, think thoughts, or sense sensations any more than you hear hearing, see sight, or smell smelling. &quot;I feel fine&quot; means that a fine feeling is present. It does not mean that there is one thing called an &quot;I&quot; and another separate thing called a feeling, so that when you bring them together this &quot;I&quot; feels the fine feeling. There are no feelings but present feelings, and whatever feeling is present is &quot;I.&quot; No one ever found an &quot;I&quot; apart from some present experience, or some experience apart from an &quot;I&quot;--which is only to say that the two are the same thing. Sanity, wholeness, and integration lie in the realization that we are not divided, that man and his present experience are one, and that no separate &quot;I&quot; or mind can be found.</p>
<p><strong>The Marvelous Moment</strong></p>
<p>The art of living in this &quot;predicament&quot; is neither careless drifting on the one hand nor fearful clinging to the past and the known on the other. It consists in being completely sensitive to each moment, in regarding it as utterly new and unique, in having the mind open and wholly receptive. This is not a philosophical theory but an experiment. One has to make the experiment to understand that it brings into play altogether new powers of adaptation to life, of literally absorbing pain and insecurity. It is as hard to describe how this absorption works as to explain the beating of one&#39;s heart or the formation of genes. The &quot;open&quot; mind does this as most of us breathe: without being able to explain it at all.</p>
<p>Once this is understood, it is really absurd to say that there is a choice or an alternative between these two ways of life, between resisting the stream in fruitless panic, and having one&#39;s eyes opened to a new world, transformed, and ever new with wonder. The key is understanding. To ask how to do this, what is the technique or method, what are the steps and rules, is to miss the point utterly. Methods are for creating things which do not yet exist. We are concerned here with understanding something which is--the present moment. This is not a psychological or spiritual discipline for self-improvement. It is simply being aware of this present experience, and realizing that you can neither define it nor divide yourself from it. There is no rule but &quot;Look!&quot;</p>
<p>As well as words can describe it, the transformation [of life] consists in knowing and feeling that the world is an organic unity.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Morality</strong></p>
<p>Among the things that give man pleasure are relations with other human beings--conversation, eating together, singing, dancing, having children, and cooperation in work which &quot;many hands make light.&quot; Indeed, one of the highest pleasures is to be more or less unconscious of one&#39;s own existence, to be absorbed in interesting sights, sounds, places, and people. Conversely, one of the greatest pains is to be self-conscious, to feel unabsorbed and cut off from the community and the surrounding world.</p>
<p>The meaning of freedom can never be grasped by the divided mind. If I feel separate from my experience, and from the world, freedom will seem to be the extent to which I can push the world around, and fate the extent to which the world pushes me around. But to the whole mind there is no contrast of &quot;I&quot; and the world. There is just one process acting, and it does everything that happens. It raises my little finger and it creates earthquakes. Or, if you want to put it that way, I raise my little finger and also make earthquakes. No one fates and no one is being fated.</p>
<p>So long as there is the motive to become something, so long as the mind believes in the possibility of escape from what it is at this moment, there can be no freedom. Virtue will be pursued for exactly the same reason as vice, and good and evil will alternate as the opposite poles of a single circle. Of course it sounds as if it were the most abject fatalism to have to admit that I am what I am, and that no escape or division is possible. It seems that if I am afraid, then I am &quot;stuck&quot; with fear. But in fact I am chained to the fear only so long as I am trying to get away from it. On the other hand, when I do not try to get away I discover that there is nothing &quot;stuck&quot; or fixed about the reality of the moment. When I am aware of this feeling without naming it, without calling it &quot;fear,&quot; &quot;bad,&quot; &quot;negative,&quot; etc., it changes instantly into something else, and life moves freely ahead. The feeling no longer perpetuates itself by creating the feeler behind it.</p>
<p>We can perhaps see now why the undivided mind is not moved into those escapes from the present which are usually called &quot;evil.&quot; The further truth that the undivided mind is aware of experience as a unity, of the world as itself, and that the whole nature of mind and awareness is to be one with what it knows, suggests a state that would usually be called love. For the love that expresses itself in creative action is something much more than an emotion. It is not something which you can &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;know,&quot; remember and define. Love is the organizing and unifying principle which makes the world a universe and the disintegrated mass a community. It is the very essence and character of mind, and becomes manifest in action when the mind is whole. For the mind must be interested or absorbed in something, just as a mirror must always be reflecting something. When it is not trying to be interested in itself--as if a mirror would reflect itself--it must be interested, or absorbed, in other people and things. There is no problem of how to love. We love. We are love, and the only problem is the direction of love, whether it is to go straight out like sunlight, or to try to turn back on itself like a &quot;candle under a bushel.&quot;</p>
<p>Where there is to be creative action, it is quite beside the point to discuss what we should or should not do in order to be right or good. A mind that is single and sincere is not interested in being good, in conducting relations with other people so as to live up to a rule. Nor, on the other hand, is it interested in being free, in acting perversely just to prove its independence. Its interest is not in itself, but in the people and problems of which it is aware; these are &quot;itself.&quot; It acts, not according to the rules, but according to the circumstances of the moment, and the &quot;well&quot; it wishes to others is not security but liberty. Nothing is really more inhuman than human relations based on morals. When a man gives bread in order to be charitable, lives with a woman in order to be faithful, eats with a Negro in order to be unprejudiced, and refuses to kill in order to be peaceful, he is as cold as a clam. He does not actually see the other person. Only a little less chilly is the benevolence springing from pity, which acts to remove suffering because it finds the sight of it disgusting. But there is no formula for generating the authentic warmth of love. It cannot be copied. You cannot talk yourself into it or rouse it by straining at the emotions or by dedicating yourself solemnly to the service of mankind. Everyone has love, but it can only come out when he is convinced of the impossibility and the frustration of trying to love himself. This conviction will not come through condemnations, through hating oneself, through calling self-love all the bad names in the universe. It comes only in the awareness that one has no self to love.</p>

<p>When you are dying and coming to life in each moment, would-be scientific predictions about what will happen after death are of little consequence. The whole glory of it is that we do not know. Ideas of survival and annihilation are alike based on the past, on memories of waking and sleeping, and, in their different ways, the notions of everlasting continuity and everlasting nothingness are without meaning.</p>
<p>If there is any problem at all, it is to see that in this instant you have no &quot;I&quot; to surrender. You are completely free to do this at any moment, and nothing whatever is stopping you. This is our freedom. We are not, however, free to improve ourselves, to surrender ourselves, to lay ourselves open to grace, for all such split-mindedness is the denial and postponement of our freedom.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to underline the vast difference between the realization that &quot;I and the Father are one,&quot; and the state of mind of the person who, as we say, &quot;thinks he is God&quot;? If, still thinking that there is an isolated &quot;I,&quot; you identify it with God, you become the insufferable ego-maniac who thinks himself successful in attaining the impossible, in dominating experience, and in pursuing all vicious circles to satisfactory conclusions.</p>
<p><em>I am the master of my fate;</em>
<em>I am the captain of my soul!</em></p>
<p>When the snake swallows his tail he has a swelled head. It is quite another thing to see that you are your &quot;fate,&quot; and that there is no one either to master it or to be mastered, to rule or to surrender. It is obvious that the only interesting people are interested people, and to be completely interested is to have forgotten about &quot;I.&quot;</p>

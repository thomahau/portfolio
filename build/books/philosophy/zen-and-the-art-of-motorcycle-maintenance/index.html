<p>When confusion starts it&#39;s a good idea to hold it down by making everything formal and exact. Sometimes just the act of writing down the problems straightens out your head as to what they really are. The logical statements entered into the notebook are broken down into six categories: (1) statement of the problem, (2) hypotheses as to the cause of the problem, (3) experiments designed to test each hypothesis, (4) predicted results of the experiments, (5) observed results of the experiments and (6) conclusions from the results of the experiments. This is not different from the formal arrangement of many college and high-school lab notebooks but the purpose here is no longer just busywork. The purpose now is precise guidance of thoughts that will fail if they are not accurate.</p>
<p>What we think of as reality is a continuous synthesis of elements from a fixed hierarchy of a priori concepts and the ever changing data of the senses.</p>
<p>You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it&#39;s going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it&#39;s always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.</p>
<p>We should not evaluate what we see. We should keep our mind a blank tablet which nature fills for us, and then reason disinterestedly from the facts we observe.</p>
<p>Stuckness shouldn&#39;t be avoided. It&#39;s the psychic predecessor of all real understanding. An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It&#39;s this understanding of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything except a new situation.</p>
<p>So the thing to do when working on a motorcycle, as in any other task, is to cultivate the peace of mind which does not separate one&#39;s self from one&#39;s surroundings. When that is done successfully then everything else follows naturally. Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all.</p>
<p>A person filled with gumption doesn&#39;t sit around dissipating and stewing about things. He&#39;s at the front of the train of his own awareness, watching to see what&#39;s up the track and meeting it when it comes. That&#39;s gumption.</p>
<p>If you have a high evaluation of yourself then your ability to recognize new facts is weakened. Your ego isolates you from the Quality reality. When the facts show that you&#39;ve just goofed, you&#39;re not as likely to admit it. When false information makes you look good, you&#39;re likely to believe it.</p>
<p>Anxiety, the next gumption trap, is sort of the opposite of ego. You&#39;re so sure you&#39;ll do everything wrong you&#39;re afraid to do anything at all. Often this, rather than &quot;laziness,&quot; is the real reason you find it hard to get started. This gumption trap of anxiety, which results from overmotivation, can lead to all kinds of errors of excessive fussiness.</p>
<p>When you&#39;re bored, stop! Go to a show. Turn on the TV. Call it a day. Do anything but work on that machine. If you don&#39;t stop, the next thing that happens is the Big Mistake, and then all the boredom plus the Big Mistake combine together in one Sunday punch to knock all the gumption out of you and you are really stopped. My favorite cure for boredom is sleep. It&#39;s very easy to get to sleep when bored and very hard to get bored after a long rest. My next favorite is coffee.</p>

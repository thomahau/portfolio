                </div>
                <p><strong>PART ONE: WRITING</strong></p>
<p>One of the gifts of being a writer is that it gives you an excuse to do things, to go places and explore. Another is that writing motivates you to look closely at life, at life as it lurches by and tramps around.</p>
<p>I took notes on the people around me, in my town, in my family, in my memory. I took notes on my own state of mind, my grandiosity, the low self-esteem. I wrote down the funny stuff I overheard. I learned to be like a ship&#39;s rat, veined ears trembling, and I learned to scribble it all down.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>Good writing is about telling the truth. We are a species that needs and wants to understand who we are.</p>
<p>Write down all the stuff you swore you&#39;d never tell another soul.</p>
<p>You sit down, I say. You try to sit down at approximately the same time every day. This is how you train your unconscious to kick in for you creatively.</p>
<p><strong>Short Assignments</strong></p>
<p>Hope, as Chesterton said, is the power of being cheerful in circumstances that we know to be desperate. Writing can be a pretty desperate endeavor, because it is about some of our deepest needs: our need to be visible, to be heard, our need to make sense of our lives, to wake up and grow and belong.</p>
<p>Say to yourself in the kindest possible way, Look, honey, all we&#39;re going to do for now is to write a description of the river at sunrise, or the young child swimming in the pool at the club, or the first time the man sees the woman he will marry. That is all we are going to do for now. We are just going to take this bird by bird. But we are going to finish this one short assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Shitty First Drafts</strong></p>
<p>The first draft is the child&#39;s draft, where you let it all pour out and then let it romp all over the place, knowing that no one is going to see it and that you can shape it later. You just let this childlike part of you channel whatever voices and visions come through and onto the page.</p>
<p><strong>Perfectionism</strong></p>
<p>Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft.</p>
<p>Perfectionism is a mean, frozen form of idealism, while messes are the artist&#39;s true friend. What people somehow (inadvertently, I&#39;m sure) forgot to mention when we were children was that we need to make messes in order to find out who we are and why we are here--and, by extension, what we&#39;re supposed to be writing.</p>
<p><strong>Polaroids</strong></p>
<p>Writing a first draft is very much like watching a Polaroid develop. You can&#39;t--and, in fact, you&#39;re not supposed to--know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing. First you just point at what has your attention and take the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Character</strong></p>
<p>Knowledge of your characters also emerges the way a Polaroid develops: it takes time for you to know them.</p>
<p>Think of the basket of each character&#39;s life: what holds the ectoplasm together--what are this person&#39;s routines, beliefs? What little things would your characters write in their journals: I ate this, I hate that, I did this, I took the dog for a long walk, I chatted with my neighbor. This is all the stuff that tethers them to the earth and to other people, all the stuff that makes each character think that life sort of makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>
<p>Plot grows out of character. If you focus on who the people in your story are, if you sit and write about two people you know and are getting to know better day by day, something is bound to happen. Characters should not, conversely, serve as pawns for some plot you&#39;ve dreamed up. I say don&#39;t worry about plot. Worry about the characters. Let what they say or do reveal who they are, and be involved in their lives, and keep asking yourself, Now what happens? The development of relationship creates plot.</p>
<p>John Gardner wrote that the writer is creating a dream into which he or she invites the reader, and that the dream must be vivid and continuous.</p>
<p><strong>PART TWO: THE WRITING FRAME OF MIND</strong></p>
<p><strong>Looking Around</strong></p>
<p>Writing is about learning to pay attention and to communicate what is going on.</p>
<p>I honestly think in order to be a writer, you have to learn to be reverent. If not, why are you writing? Why are you here? Let&#39;s think of reverence as awe, as presence in and openness to the world. The alternative is that we stultify, we shut down. I think this is how we are supposed to be in the world--present and in awe.</p>
<p><strong>The Moral Point of View</strong></p>
<p>If you find that you start a number of stories or pieces that you don&#39;t ever bother finishing, that you lose interest or faith in them along the way, it may be that there is nothing at their center about which you care passionately. You need to put yourself at their center, you and what you believe to be true or right. The core, ethical concepts in which you most passionately believe are the language in which you are writing.</p>
<p>Maybe what you care most passionately about are fasting and high colonics--cappuccino enemas, say. This is fine, but we do not want you to write about them; we will secretly believe that you are simply spiritualizing your hysteria. There are millions of people already doing this at churches and New Age festivals across the land. Write instead about freedom, freedoms worth fighting for.</p>
<p>Take the attitude that what you are thinking and feeling is valuable stuff, and then be naive enough to get it all down on paper. But be careful: if your intuition says that your story sucks, make sure it really is your intuition and not your mother.</p>
<p>Writing is about hypnotizing yourself into believing in yourself, getting some work done, then unhypnotizing yourself and going over the material coldly.</p>
<p><strong>Radio Station KFKD</strong></p>
<p>If you are not careful, station KFKD will play in your head twenty-four hours a day, nonstop, in stereo. Out of the right speaker in your inner ear will come the endless stream of self-aggrandizement, the recitation of one&#39;s specialness, of how much more open and gifted and brilliant and knowing and misunderstood and humble one is. Out of the left speaker will be the rap songs of self-loathing, the lists of all the things one doesn&#39;t do well, of all the mistakes one has made today and over an entire lifetime, the doubt, the assertion that everything that one touches turns to shit, that one doesn&#39;t do relationships well, that one is in every way a fraud, incapable of selfless love, that one has no talent or insight, and on and on and.</p>
<p>Sometimes ritual quiets the racket. Try it. Rituals are a good signal to your unconscious that it is time to kick in.</p>
<p><strong>PART THREE: HELP ALONG THE WAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Index Cards</strong></p>
<p>I believe in lists and I believe in taking notes, and I believe in index cards for doing both.</p>
<p>Whenever I am leaving the house without my purse--in which there are actual notepads, let alone index cards--I fold an index card lengthwise in half, stick it in my back pocket along with a pen, and head out, knowing that if I have an idea, or see something lovely or strange or for any reason worth remembering, I will be able to jot down a couple of words to remind me of it. Sometimes, if I overhear or think of an exact line of dialogue or a transition, I write it down verbatim. I stick the card back in my pocket.</p>
<p>One of the things that happens when you give yourself permission to start writing is that you start thinking like a writer. You start seeing everything as material.</p>
<p><strong>Calling Around</strong></p>
<p>There are an enormous number of people out there with invaluable information to share with you, and all you have to do is pick up the phone. They love it when you do, just as you love it when people ask if they can pick your brain about something you happen to know a great deal about--or, as in my case, have a number of impassioned opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Letters</strong></p>
<p>When you don&#39;t know what else to do, when you&#39;re really stuck and filled with despair and self-loathing and boredom, but you can&#39;t just leave your work alone for a while and wait, you might try telling part of your history--part of a character&#39;s history--in the form of a letter. The letter&#39;s informality just might free you from the tyranny of perfectionism.</p>
<p><strong>Writer&#39;s Block</strong></p>
<p>The problem is acceptance, which is something we&#39;re taught not to do. We&#39;re taught to improve uncomfortable situations, to change things, alleviate unpleasant feelings. But if you accept the reality that you have been given--that you are not in a productive creative period--you free yourself to begin filling up again. I encourage my students at times like these to get one page of anything written, three hundred words of memories or dreams or stream of consciousness on how much they hate writing--just for the hell of it, just to keep their fingers from becoming too arthritic, just because they have made a commitment to try to write three hundred words every day. Then, on bad days and weeks, let things go at that.</p>
<p>I remind myself of this when I cannot get any work done: to live as if I am dying, because the truth is we are all terminal on this bus. To live as if we are dying gives us a chance to experience some real presence. Time is so full for people who are dying in a conscious way, full in the way that life is for children. They spend big round hours. So instead of staring miserably at the computer screen trying to will my way into having a breakthrough, I say to myself, &quot;Okay, hmmm, let&#39;s see. Dying tomorrow. What should I do today?&quot; Then I can decide to read Wallace Stevens for the rest of the morning or go to the beach or just really participate in ordinary life. Any of these will begin the process of filling me back up with observations, flavors, ideas, visions, memories. I might want to write on my last day on earth, but I&#39;d also be aware of other options that would feel at least as pressing. I would want to keep whatever I did simple, I think. And I would want to be present.</p>
<p>In the beginning, when you&#39;re first starting out, there are a million reasons not to write, to give up. That is why it is of extreme importance to make a commitment to finishing sections and stories, to driving through to the finish. The discouraging voices will hound you--&quot;This is all piffle,&quot; they will say, and they may be right. What you are doing may just be practice. But this is how you are going to get better, and there is no point in practicing if you don&#39;t finish.</p>
<p><strong>PART FOUR: PUBLICATION-- AND OTHER REASONS TO WRITE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Writing a Present</strong></p>
<p>Twice now I have written books that began as presents to people I loved who were going to die.</p>
<p>I sat down with my index cards, and I looked through the one-inch picture frame, and started writing.</p>
<p>Toni Morrison said, &quot;The function of freedom is to free someone else,&quot; and if you are no longer wracked or in bondage to a person or a way of life, tell your story. Risk freeing someone else. Not everyone will be glad that you did. Members of your family and other critics may wish you had kept your secrets. Oh, well, what are you going to do? Get it all down. Let it pour out of you onto the page. Write an incredibly shitty, self-indulgent, whiny, mewling first draft. Then take out as many of the excesses as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Finding Your Voice</strong></p>
<p>We write to expose the unexposed. If there is one door in the castle you have been told not to go through, you must. Otherwise, you&#39;ll just be rearranging furniture in rooms you&#39;ve already been in. Most human beings are dedicated to keeping that one door shut. But the writer&#39;s job is to see what&#39;s behind it, to see the bleak unspeakable stuff, and to turn the unspeakable into words--not just into any words but if we can, into rhythm and blues.</p>
<p>Write as if your parents are dead.</p>
<p><strong>Giving</strong></p>
<p>Annie Dillard has said that day by day you have to give the work before you all the best stuff you have, not saving up for later projects. If you give freely, there will always be more. This is a radical proposition that runs so contrary to human nature, or at least to my nature, that I personally keep trying to find loopholes in it. But it is only when I go ahead and decide to shoot my literary, creative wad on a daily basis that I get any sense of full presence, of being Zorba the Greek at the keyboard. Otherwise I am a wired little rodent squirreling things away, hoarding and worrying about supply.</p>
<p>You are going to have to give and give and give, or there&#39;s no reason for you to be writing. You have to give from the deepest part of yourself, and you are going to have to go on giving, and the giving is going to have to be its own reward. There is no cosmic importance to your getting something published, but there is in learning to be a giver.</p>
<p><strong>More Advice</strong></p>
<p>Write about your childhoods, I tell them for the umpteenth time. Write about that time in your life when you were so intensely interested in the world, when your powers of observation were at their most acute, when you felt things so deeply. Exploring and understanding your childhood will give you the ability to empathize, and that understanding and empathy will teach you to write with intelligence and insight and compassion.</p>
<p>Try to write in a directly emotional way, instead of being too subtle or oblique. Don&#39;t be afraid of your material or your past. Be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you. Be afraid of not getting your writing done.</p>
<p>Something inside you is real, we will probably find it interesting, and it will probably be universal. So you must risk placing real emotion at the center of your work. Write straight into the emotional center of things. Write toward vulnerability. Don&#39;t worry about appearing sentimental. Worry about being unavailable; worry about being absent or fraudulent. Risk being unliked. Tell the truth as you understand it. If you&#39;re a writer, you have a moral obligation to do this. And it is a revolutionary act--truth is always subversive.</p>
<p>Being a writer is part of a noble tradition, as is being a musician--the last egalitarian and open associations. No matter what happens in terms of fame and fortune, dedication to writing is a marching-step forward from where you were before, when you didn&#39;t care about reaching out to the world, when you weren&#39;t hoping to contribute, when you were just standing there doing some job into which you had fallen.</p>
<p>You simply keep putting down one damn word after the other, as you hear them, as they come to you. You can either set brick as a laborer or as an artist. You can make the work a chore, or you can have a good time. You can do it the way you used to clear the dinner dishes when you were thirteen, or you can do it as a Japanese person would perform a tea ceremony, with a level of concentration and care in which you can lose yourself, and so in which you can find yourself.</p>
<p>To participate requires self-discipline and trust and courage, because this business of becoming conscious, of being a writer, is ultimately about asking yourself, as my friend Dale puts it, How alive am I willing to be?</p>

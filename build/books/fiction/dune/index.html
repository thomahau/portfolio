                <p>&quot;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The mind can go either direction under stress --toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called &quot;spannungsbogen&quot; --which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.</p>

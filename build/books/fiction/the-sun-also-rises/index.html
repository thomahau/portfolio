                <p>&quot;You can&#39;t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There&#39;s nothing to that.&quot;</p>
<p>It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.</p>
<p>I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.</p>
<p>It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.</p>
<p>That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a large statement.</p>
<p><strong>From The Complete Short Stories</strong></p>
<p>In going where you have to go, and doing what you have to do, and seeing what you have to see, you dull and blunt the instrument you write with. But I would rather have it bent and dull and know I had to put it on the grindstone again and hammer it into shape and put a whetstone to it, and know that I had something to write about, than to have it bright and shining and nothing to say, or smooth and well-oiled in the closet, but unused.</p>

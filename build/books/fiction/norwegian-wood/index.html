                <p>Memory is a funny thing. When I was in the scene I hardly paid it any attention. I never stopped to think of it as something that would make a lasting impression, certainly never imagined that 18 years later I would recall it in such detail.</p>
<p>Which is why I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens to be the way I&#39;m made. I have to write things down to feel I fully comprehend them.</p>
<p>Once, long ago, when I was still young, when the memories were far more vivid than they are now, I often tried to write about her. But I couldn&#39;t produce a line. I knew that if that first line would come, the rest would pour itself onto the page, but I could never make it happen. Everything was too sharp and clear, so that I could never tell where to start – the way a map that shows too much can sometimes be useless.</p>
<p>He had a rare talent for finding the interesting parts of someone&#39;s generally uninteresting comments so that, while speaking to him, you felt you were an exceptionally interesting person with an exceptionally interesting life.</p>
<p>Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life.</p>
<p>I read a lot, but not a lot of different books: I like to read my favourites again and again. Back then it was Truman Capote, John Updike, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Chandler. At 18 my favourite book was John Updike&#39;s The Centaur, but after I had read it a number of times, it began to lose some of its initial lustre and yielded first place to The Great Gatsby. Gatsby stayed in first place for a long time after that. I would pull it off the shelf when the mood hit me and read a section at random. It never once disappointed me.</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of authors do you like?&quot; I asked, speaking in respectful tones to this man two years my senior. &quot;Balzac, Dante, Joseph Conrad, Dickens,&quot; he answered without hesitation. &quot;Not exactly fashionable.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s why I read them. If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking. That&#39;s the world of hicks and slobs. Real people would be ashamed of themselves doing that.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you look better now than you did before,&quot; I said. And I meant it. As far as I could recall, with long hair she had been just another cute student. A fresh and physical life force surged from the girl who sat before me now. She was like a small animal that has popped into the world with the coming of spring. Her eyes moved like an independent organism with joy, laughter, anger, amazement and despair. I hadn&#39;t seen a face so vivid and expressive in ages, and I enjoyed watching it live and move.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re very clear about what you like and what you don&#39;t like,&quot; she said. &quot;Maybe so,&quot; I said. &quot;Maybe that&#39;s why people don&#39;t like me. Never have.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s because you show it,&quot; she said. &quot;You make it obvious you don&#39;t care whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s the kind of death that frightens me. The shadow of death slowly, slowly eats away at the region of life, and before you know it everything&#39;s dark and you can&#39;t see, and the people around you think of you as more dead than alive. I hate that. I couldn&#39;t stand it.&quot;</p>
<p>Girls my age never use the word &quot;fair&quot;. Ordinary girls as young as I am are basically indifferent to whether things are fair or not. The central question for them is not whether something is fair but whether or not it&#39;s beautiful or will make them happy. &quot;Fair&quot; is a man&#39;s word, finally, but I can&#39;t help feeling that it is also exactly the right word for me now. And because questions of beauty and happiness have become such difficult and convoluted propositions for me now, I suspect, I find myself clinging instead to other standards – like, whether or not something is fair or honest or universally true.</p>
<p>&quot;Languages are like games. You learn the rules for one, and they all work the same way. Like women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A riddle wrapped in an enigma.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So cute the mountains crumble and the oceans dry up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t feel sorry for yourself,&quot; he said. &quot;Only arseholes do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You try too hard to make life fit your way of doing things. If you don&#39;t want to spend time in an insane asylum, you have to open up a little more and let yourself go with life&#39;s natural flow.&quot;</p>

                <p>What is this state, seeing the difference between good and bad and choosing bad – or consenting to bad, okaying bad?</p>
<p>My memory&#39;s in good shape, I think. It&#39;s just that my life is getting less memorable all the time.</p>
<p>I&#39;d hoped that the attack had been random. In my state, you&#39;re always hoping things are random. You don&#39;t want things assuming any shape on you.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the same with life. Do you want to feel good young or do you want to feel good old? One or the other, not both.</p>
<p>Oh Christ, the exhaustion of not knowing anything. It&#39;s so tiring and hard on the nerves. It really takes it out of you, not knowing anything. You&#39;re given comedy and miss all the jokes. Every hour, you get weaker. Sometimes, as I sit alone in my flat in London and stare at the window, I think how dismal it is, how hard, how heavy, to watch the rain and not know why it falls.</p>
<p>‘Say,&#39; I said (and here was my gimmick): ‘I had a swell dream about you the other night.&#39; Normally, with this line, in my experience you get either coy withdrawal or outright panic, depending on the dame.</p>
<p>London is full of short stories walking round hand in hand.</p>
<p>You can kill time in a number of ways but it always depends on the kind of time you&#39;re fighting: some time is unkillable, immortal. Whenever I did anything I always wanted to be doing something else but when I started doing something else I found I didn&#39;t want to do that either.</p>
<p>Get them when they&#39;re crying. Close in when they&#39;re crying. They&#39;re weak and raw and they can&#39;t keep you out.</p>

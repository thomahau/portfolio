<p>&quot;New knowledge is the most valuable commodity on earth. The more truth we have to work with, the richer we become.&quot;</p>
<p>As a Bokononist, of course, I would have agreed gaily to go anywhere anyone suggested. As Bokonon says: &quot;Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.&quot;</p>
<p>Busy, busy, busy, is what we Bokononists whisper whenever we think of how complicated and unpredictable the machinery of life really is.</p>
<p>&quot;Busy, busy, busy.&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s what we Bokononists say,&quot; he said, &quot;when we feel that a lot of mysterious things are going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The people down there are poor enough and scared enough and ignorant enough to have some common sense!&quot;</p>
<p>It was the belief of Bokonon that good societies could be built only by pitting good against evil, and by keeping the tension between the two high at all times.</p>
<p>&quot;Truth was the enemy of the people, because the truth was so terrible, so Bokonon made it his business to provide the people with better and better lies.&quot;</p>

                <p>Happy. Just in my swim shorts, barefooted, wild-haired, in the red fire dark, singing, swigging wine, spitting, jumping, running – that&#39;s the way to live.</p>
<p>‘Pretty girls make graves,&#39; was my saying.</p>
<p>Japhy was considered an eccentric around the campus, which is the usual thing for campuses and college people to think whenever a real man appears on the scene – colleges being nothing but grooming schools for the middle-class non-identity which usually finds its perfect expression on the outskirts of the campus in rows of well-to-do houses with lawns and television sets in each living room with everybody looking at the same thing and thinking the same thing at the same time while the Japhies of the world go prowling in the wilderness to hear the voice crying in the wilderness, to find the ecstasy of the stars, to find the dark mysterious secret of the origin of faceless wonderless crapulous civilization.</p>
<p>‘Comparisons are odious, Smith,&#39; he sent sailing back to me, quoting Cervantes and making a Zen Buddhist observation to boot.</p>
<p>The woods do that to you, they always look familiar, long lost, like the face of a long-dead relative, like an old dream, like a piece of forgotten song drifting across the water, most of all like golden eternities of past childhood or past manhood and all the living and dying and the heartbreak that went on a million years ago and the clouds as they pass overhead seem to testify (by their own lonesome familiarity) to this feeling.</p>
<p>The famous Zen saying, ‘When you get to the top of a mountain, keep climbing.&#39;</p>
<p>I wanted to get me a full pack complete with everything necessary to sleep, shelter, eat, cook, in fact a regular kitchen and bedroom right on my back, and go off somewhere and find perfect solitude and look into the perfect emptiness of my mind and be completely neutral from any and all ideas.</p>
<p>‘Oh my God, sociability is just a big smile and a big smile is nothing but teeth, I wish I could just stay up here and rest and be kind.&#39;</p>
<p>The closer you get to real matter, rock air fire and wood, boy, the more spiritual the world is. All these people thinking they&#39;re hardheaded materialistic practical types, they don&#39;t know shit about matter, their heads are full of dreamy ideas and notions.&#39;</p>
<p>But let the mind beware, that though the flesh be bugged, the circumstances of existence are pretty glorious.</p>

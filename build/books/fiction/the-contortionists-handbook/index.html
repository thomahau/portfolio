                <p>What they wear tells you what they want to show, and what they show tells you what they want to hide.</p>
<p>A person&#39;s life story is equal to what they have plus what they want most in the world, minus what they&#39;re actually willing to sacrifice for it.</p>
<p>The smartest thing that a smart person can do is keep those smarts hidden in plain sight.</p>
<p>She was everything I&#39;ve ever come to hate: the authority of the State with the mind of a child fighting for sandbox territory. I could tell by her hands that her closest companion was her cat, which meant she had no husband, boyfriend or girlfriend. She hated any life more colorful than hers.</p>
<p>What did they want most, what had they settled for and what were they compensating with?</p>
<p>Guys who want to kick your ass don&#39;t know the look in the eyes of somebody who knows how to seriously hurt you or worse, and who doesn&#39;t have anything to lose from doing so. It&#39;s a look you see in the eyes of a stray dog. Not a look of aggression because aggression is personal. It&#39;s an assessment: Are you food? Are you a threat? The answers take half a second and if the answers are both no, then the dog keeps moving.</p>
<p>My paranoia is greater than the sum of its parts and, because of that, I am free to come and go.</p>
<p>You slam the car door, then remember your keys. The plane lifts off, you remember the coffeepot is still on. That wordless, bone-deep, quantum-second understanding where your whole body is shocked with cold static.</p>

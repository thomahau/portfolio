The answers take half a second and if the answers are both no, then the dog keeps moving.</p>
<p>My paranoia is greater than the sum of its parts and, because of that, I am free to come and go.</p>
<p>You slam the car door, then remember your keys. The plane lifts off, you remember the coffeepot is still on. That wordless, bone-deep, quantum-second understanding where your whole body is shocked with cold static.</p>

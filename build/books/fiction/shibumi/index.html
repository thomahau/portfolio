                <p>&quot;Shibumi has to do with great refinement underlying commonplace appearances. It is a statement so correct that it does not have to be bold, so poignant it does not have to be pretty, so true it does not have to be real. Shibumi is understanding, rather than knowledge. Eloquent silence. In demeanor, it is modesty without pudency. In art, where the spirit of shibumi takes the form of sabi, it is elegant simplicity, articulate brevity. In philosophy, where shibumi emerges as wabi, it is spiritual tranquility that is not passive; it is being without the angst of becoming. And in the personality of a man, it is… how does one say it? Authority without domination? Something like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Do not fall into the error of the artisan who boasts of twenty years experience in his craft while in fact he has had only one year of experience--twenty times.</p>
<p>&quot;Your defeats will not come from those more brilliant than you. They will come from the patient, the plodding, the mediocre. Your scorn for mediocrity blinds you to its vast primitive power. You stand in the glare of your own brilliance, unable to see into the dim corners of the room, to dilate your eyes and see the potential dangers of the mass, the wad of humanity. Even as I tell you this, dear student, you cannot quite believe that lesser men, in whatever numbers, can really defeat you. But we are in the age of the mediocre man. He is dull, colorless, boring--but inevitably victorious. The amoeba outlives the tiger because it divides and continues in its immortal monotony. The masses are the final tyrants. See how, in the arts, Kabuki wanes and Nô withers while popular novels of violence and mindless action swamp the mind of the mass reader. And even in that timid genre, no author dares to produce a genuinely superior man as his hero, for in his rage of shame the mass man will send his yojimbo, the critic, to defend him. The roar of the plodders is inarticulate, but deafening. They have no brain, but they have a thousand arms to grasp and clutch at you, drag you down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am afraid I have made a waste of the years of training.&quot; &quot;No. It is one of the things one cannot waste. You have learned to concentrate deeply, to think subtly, to have affection for abstractions, to live at a distance from quotidian things. Not a waste.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a mosquito of a problem, stupid and irritating, the overcoming of which brought no glory.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people of your age and class are so wrapped up in themselves--so concerned with what they&#39;re ‘into&#39;--that they fail to realize that style and form are everything, and substance a passing myth.&quot; He opened his eyes and smiled as he made a pallid effort to imitate the American accent: &quot;It ain&#39;t what you do, it&#39;s how you do it.&quot;</p>
<p>In the long run, the &quot;minor&quot; virtues are the only ones that matter. Politeness is more reliable than the moist virtues of compassion, charity, and sincerity; just as fair play is more important than the abstraction of justice. The major virtues tend to disintegrate under the pressures of convenient rationalization. But good form is good form, and it stands immutable in the storm of circumstance.</p>
<p>Once severed from the future, the past becomes an insignificant parade of trivial events, no longer organic, no longer potent or painful.</p>

                </div>
                <p>&quot;We create our fate,&quot; says Miller. And better still: &quot;Forget, forgive, renounce, abdicate.&quot; And &quot;scrap the past instantly.&quot; Live the good life instantly; it&#39;s now or never, and always has been.</p>
<p>I have no money, no resources, no hopes. I am the happiest man alive.</p>
<p>We have so many points in common that it is like looking at myself in a cracked mirror.</p>
<p>There are people who cannot resist the desire to get into a cage with wild beasts and be mangled.</p>
<p>I have made a silent compact with myself not to change a line of what I write. I am not interested in perfecting my thoughts, nor my actions.</p>
<p>Everywhere I go people are making a mess of their lives. Everyone has his private tragedy. It&#39;s in the blood now--misfortune, ennui, grief, suicide. The atmosphere is saturated with disaster, frustration, futility. Scratch and scratch--until there&#39;s no skin left. However, the effect upon me is exhilarating. Instead of being discouraged, or depressed, I enjoy it. I am crying for more and more disasters, for bigger calamities, for grander failures. I want the whole world to be out of whack, I want everyone to scratch himself to death.</p>
<p>Somehow the realization that nothing was to be hoped for had a salutary effect upon me. For weeks and months, for years, in fact, all my life I had been looking forward to something happening, some extrinsic event that would alter my life, and now suddenly, inspired by the absolute hopelessness of everything, I felt relieved, felt as though a great burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I decided to let myself drift with the tide, to make not the least resistance to fate, no matter in what form it presented itself. Nothing that had happened to me thus far had been sufficient to destroy me; nothing had been destroyed except my illusions. I myself was intact. The world was intact. Tomorrow there might be a revolution, a plague, an earthquake; tomorrow there might not be left a single soul to whom one could turn for sympathy, for aid, for faith. It seemed to me that the great calamity had already manifested itself, that I could be no more truly alone than at this very moment. I made up my mind that I would hold on to nothing, that I would expect nothing, that henceforth I would live as an animal, a beast of prey, a rover, a plunderer.</p>
<p>It seems as if my own proper existence had come to an end somewhere, just where exactly I can&#39;t make out. I&#39;m not an American any more, nor a New Yorker, and even less a European, or a Parisian. I haven&#39;t any allegiance, any responsibilities, any hatreds, any worries, any prejudices, any passion. I&#39;m neither for nor against. I&#39;m a neutral.</p>
<p>I liked the way Collins moved against this background of literature continuously; it was like a millionaire who never stepped out of his Rolls Royce. There was no intermediate realm for him between reality and ideas.</p>
<p>Paris is like a whore. From a distance she seems ravishing, you can&#39;t wait until you have her in your arms. And five minutes later you feel empty, disgusted with yourself. You feel tricked.</p>
<p>In Whitman the whole American scene comes to life, her past and her future, her birth and her death. Whatever there is of value in America Whitman has expressed, and there is nothing more to be said. The future belongs to the machine, to the robots. He was the Poet of the Body and the Soul, Whitman. The first and the last poet.</p>
<p>When I look down into this fucked-out cunt of a whore I feel the whole world beneath me, a world tottering and crumbling, a world used up and polished like a leper&#39;s skull.</p>
<p>Today I awoke from a sound sleep with curses of joy on my lips, with gibberish on my tongue, repeating to myself like a litany--&quot;Fay ce que vouldras!… fay ce que vouldras!&quot; Do anything, but let it produce joy. Do anything, but let it yield ecstasy. So much crowds into my head when I say this to myself: images, gay ones, terrible ones, maddening ones, the wolf and the goat, the spider, the crab, syphilis with her wings outstretched and the door of the womb always on the latch, always open, ready like the tomb. Lust, crime, holiness: the lives of my adored ones, the failures of my adored ones, the words they left behind them, the words they left unfinished; the good they dragged after them and the evil, the sorrow, the discord, the rancor, the strife they created. But above all, the ecstasy!</p>
<p>Once I thought that to be human was the highest aim a man could have, but I see now that it was meant to destroy me. Today I am proud to say that I am inhuman, that I belong not to men and governments, that I have nothing to do with creeds and principles. I have nothing to do with the creaking machinery of humanity--I belong to the earth!</p>
<p>If I am inhuman it is because my world has slopped over its human bounds, because to be human seems like a poor, sorry, miserable affair, limited by the senses, restricted by moralities and codes, defined by platitudes and isms.</p>
<p>There&#39;s something obscene in this love of the past which ends in breadlines and dugouts. Something obscene about this spiritual racket which permits an idiot to sprinkle holy water over Big Berthas and dreadnoughts and high explosives. Every man with a bellyful of the classics is an enemy to the human race.</p>
<p>Ask anything!--that was my motto. I&#39;m here as a plenipotentiary from the realm of free spirits. I&#39;m here to create a fever and a ferment.</p>
<p>Alone, with a tremendous empty longing and dread. The whole room for my thoughts. Nothing but myself and what I think, what I fear. Could think the most fantastic thoughts, could dance, spit, grimace, curse, wail--nobody would ever know, nobody would ever hear. The thought of such absolute privacy is enough to drive me mad. It&#39;s like a clean birth. Everything cut away. Separate, naked, alone. Bliss and agony simultaneously. Time on your hands. Each second weighing on you like a mountain. You drown in it. Deserts, seas, lakes, oceans. Time beating away like a meat ax. Nothingness. The world. The me and the not-me. <em>Oomaharumooma</em>. Everything has to have a name. Everything has to be learned, tested, experienced. Faites comme chez vous, chéri.</p>
<p>Human beings make a strange fauna and flora. From a distance they appear negligible; close up they are apt to appear ugly and malicious. More than anything they need to be surrounded with sufficient space--space even more than time.</p>

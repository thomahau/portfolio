                </div>
                <p>If my typical man wishes to live fully and completely he must, in his mind, arrange a day within a day. And this inner day, a Chinese box in a larger Chinese box, must begin at 6 p.m. and end at 10 a.m. It is a day of sixteen hours; and during all these sixteen hours he has nothing whatever to do but cultivate his body and his soul and his fellow men. During those sixteen hours he is free; he is not a wage-earner; he is not preoccupied with monetary cares; he is just as good as a man with a private income. This must be his attitude.</p>
<p>I do suggest that you might, for a commencement, employ an hour and a half every other evening in some important and consecutive cultivation of the mind. If you persevere you will soon want to pass four evenings, and perhaps five, in some sustained endeavour to be genuinely alive. And you will fall out of that habit of muttering to yourself at 11.15 p.m., &quot;Time to be thinking about going to bed.&quot; The man who begins to go to bed forty minutes before he opens his bedroom door is bored; that is to say, he is not living.</p>
<p>A life in which conduct does not fairly well accord with principles is a silly life; and that conduct can only be made to accord with principles by means of daily examination, reflection, and resolution.</p>
<p>Books are valuable. But no reading of books will take the place of a daily, candid, honest examination of what one has recently done, and what one is about to do--of a steady looking at one&#39;s self in the face (disconcerting though the sight may be).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Define the direction and scope of your efforts. Choose a limited period, or a limited subject, or a single author. Say to yourself: &quot;I will know something about the French Revolution, or the rise of railways, or the works of John Keats.&quot; And during a given period, to be settled beforehand, confine yourself to your choice. There is much pleasure to be derived from being a specialist.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Think as well as read. I know people who read and read, and for all the good it does them they might just as well cut bread-and-butter. They take to reading as better men take to drink. They fly through the shires of literature on a motor-car, their sole object being motion. They will tell you how many books they have read in a year. Unless you give at least forty-five minutes to careful, fatiguing reflection (it is an awful bore at first) upon what you are reading, your ninety minutes of a night are chiefly wasted. This means that your pace will be slow.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When one sets forth on the enterprise of using all one&#39;s time, it is just as well to remember that one&#39;s own time, and not other people&#39;s time, is the material with which one has to deal; that the earth rolled on pretty comfortably before one began to balance a budget of the hours, and that it will continue to roll on pretty comfortably whether or not one succeeds in one&#39;s new role of chancellor of the exchequer of time. It is as well not to chatter too much about what one is doing, and not to betray a too-pained sadness at the spectacle of a whole world deliberately wasting so many hours out of every day, and therefore never really living. It will be found, ultimately, that in taking care of one&#39;s self one has quite all one can do.</p>
<p>A failure at the commencement may easily kill outright the newborn impulse towards a complete vitality, and therefore every precaution should be observed to avoid it. The impulse must not be over-taxed. Let the pace of the first lap be even absurdly slow, but let it be as regular as possible. And, having once decided to achieve a certain task, achieve it at all costs of tedium and distaste. The gain in self-confidence of having accomplished a tiresome labour is immense.</p>

<p><strong>A Magic Formula For Solving Worry Situations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ask yourself,&#39; &#39;What is the worst that can possibly happen?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prepare to accept it if you have to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then calmly proceed to improve on the worst.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How To Break The Worry Habit Before It Breaks You</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>RULE 1: Crowd worry out of your mind by keeping busy. Plenty of action is one of the best therapies ever devised for curing &quot;wibber gibbers&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 2: Don&#39;t fuss about trifles. Don&#39;t permit little things-the mere termites of life-to ruin your happiness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 3: Use the law of averages to outlaw your worries. Ask yourself: &quot;What are the odds against this thing&#39;s happening at all?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 4: Co-operate with the inevitable. If you know a circumstance is beyond your power to change or revise, say to yourself &quot;It is so; it cannot be otherwise.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 5: Put a &quot;stop-loss&quot; order on your worries. Decide just how much anxiety a thing may be worth-and refuse to give it any more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 6: Let the past bury its dead. Don&#39;t saw sawdust.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seven Ways To Cultivate A Mental Attitude That Will Bring You Peace And Happiness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>RULE 1: Let&#39;s fill our minds with thoughts of peace, courage, health, and hope, for &quot;our life is what our thoughts make it&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 2: Let&#39;s never try to get even with our enemies, because if we do we will hurt ourselves far more than we hurt them. Let&#39;s do as General Eisenhower does: let&#39;s never waste a minute thinking about people we don&#39;t like.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 3: A. Instead of worrying about ingratitude, let&#39;s expect it. Let&#39;s remember that Jesus healed ten lepers in one day-and only one thanked Him. Why should we expect more gratitude than Jesus got? B. Let&#39;s remember that the only way to find happiness is not to expect gratitude-but to give for the joy of giving. C. Let&#39;s remember that gratitude is a &quot;cultivated&quot; trait; so if we want our children to be grateful, we must train them to be grateful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 4: Count your blessings-not your troubles!</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 5: Let&#39;s not imitate others. Let&#39;s find ourselves and be ourselves, for &quot;envy is ignorance&quot; and &quot;imitation is suicide&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 6: When fate hands us a lemon, let&#39;s try to make a lemonade.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 7: Let&#39;s forget our own unhappiness-by trying to create a little happiness for others. &quot;When you are good to others, you are best to yourself.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How To Keep From Worrying About Criticism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>RULE 1: Unjust criticism is often a disguised compliment. It often means that you have aroused jealousy and envy. Remember that no one ever kicks a dead dog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 2: Do the very best you can; and then put up your old umbrella and keep the rain of criticism from running down the back of your neck.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RULE 3: Let&#39;s keep a record of the fool things we have done and criticise ourselves. Since we can&#39;t hope to be perfect, let&#39;s do what E. H. Little did: let&#39;s ask for unbiased, helpful, constructive criticism.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Four Good Working Habits That Will Help Prevent Fatigue And Worry Good Working</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Clear Your Desk of All Papers Except Those Relating to the Immediate Problem at Hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do Things in the Order of Their Importance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When You Face a Problem, Solve It Then and There if You Have the Facts Necessary to Make a Decision. Don&#39;t Keep Putting off Decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn to Organise, Deputise, and Supervise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Good writing is the kind that transfers your thoughts and emotions to the reader- and to do that, you don&#39;t need a large vocabulary, but you do need ideas, experience, convictions, examples and excitement.</p>
<p>Remember what George Bernard Shaw said? &quot;The secret of being miserable is to have the leisure to bother about whether you are happy or not.&quot; Keep active, keep busy!</p>

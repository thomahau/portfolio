                <p><strong>Focusing exercise</strong></p>
<p>Two minutes, three breaths at each step</p>
<ul>
<li>Letting go of the past</li>
<li>Letting go of the future</li>
<li>Centering in the present</li>
</ul>
<p>As you begin to speak to yourself in a language that focuses on <em>results</em> rather than <em>blame</em>, on <em>choice</em> rather than <em>have to</em>, on what _is_ rather than what you think <em>should be</em>, you will find that your body and mind cooperate by providing a level of <em>positive energy</em>, without stress or anxiety, free from unnecessary struggles of the past and negative comparisons with the future.</p>
<p>Negative language: avoid &quot;<em>have to</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>should</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Positive language:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am going to the store</li>
<li>I will be at the dentist at 3 PM</li>
<li>I am going to traffic court this morning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Replacing negative attitudes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replace &quot;I have to&quot; by &quot;<strong>I choose to</strong>&quot; in your inner dialogue</li>
<li>Replace &quot;I must finish&quot; with &quot;<strong>When can I start?</strong>&quot; Focuses energy on what can be tackled now</li>
<li>Replace &quot;This is so big&quot; with &quot;<strong>I can take one small step</strong>&quot;</li>
<li>Replace &quot;I must be perfect&quot; with &quot;<strong>I can be human.</strong>&quot; Add <em>acceptance of</em> (not <em>resignation to</em>) your human limits</li>
<li>Procrastinator: &quot;I have to finish something big and do it perfectly while working hard for long periods of time without time to play.&quot; Producer: &quot;<strong>I choose to start on one small imperfect step knowing I have plenty of time for play</strong>&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Putting off living&quot; is the most tragic form of procrastination we can engage in. Not only does it keep us from completing the really important tasks in life, it lessens our respect for ourselves.</p>
<p>Three major blocks to action</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of being overwhelmed</li>
<li>Fear of failure</li>
<li>Fear of finishing</li>
</ul>
<p>All large tasks are completed in a series of starts: keep on starting, and finishing will take care of itself.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes can be all the time in the world to solve a problem when you are intensely focused. The important thing is that <em>you got started</em>.</p>
<p>Before deciding to go to a recreational activity or social commitment, take time out for just thirty minutes of quality work.</p>
